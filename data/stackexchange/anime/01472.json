The gif below shows Noriko from minute 11 of GunBuster's episode 3.\n\nThis is the dialogue directly preceding it:\nIn terms of usage it seems somewhat interchangeable with the Eyelid pull taunt. I assumed it is meant to show defiance, kind of like baring one's teeth but in a more cheeky way?\nThe sound she makes is \"bi-\" I would say, but her action doesn't really fit any of the common uses of that onomatopoeia which I'm aware of. \nI feel I've seen this before but I couldn't find it among any of the teeth and smile realated tropes on tvtropes.\nSo, TL;DR, does this have a name, is it repeated throughout anime and signifies something particular or is it just Noriko being random and I'm overthinking it?\n", "post_id": "28353", "cluster_id": 1472, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
