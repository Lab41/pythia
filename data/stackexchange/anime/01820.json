{"body_text": "How did Chino's grandfather ends up as a rabbit? From the first episode of Gochuumon wa Usagi desuka? (Is the order a rabbit?) Chino's grandfather was depicted as a rabbit (very questionable since he didn't look like a rabbit, but the anime says so, so let's call him a rabbit). However, considering that both Chino's father and Chino is a normal human, and that the writer who often come to Chino's cafe (Rabbit House) used to have talks with the first owner (Chino's grandfather), there must be a time where he was a normal human. Otherwise, the writer lady would have noticed it was him when she saw the rabbit. Also since the rabbit has no arms (at least the first season doesn't show it to have arms), and considering his size, he wouldn't be able to pour coffee. Has it been explained somewhere (anime and manga) why Chino's grandfather turned into a rabbit?\nNote: I haven't watched the second season. Please carefully put spoilers at its rightful place.\n", "post_id": "33634", "cluster_id": 1820, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
