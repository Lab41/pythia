Note: this topic was somewhat addressed in this question, but remained unclear to me after reading the answers to it.\nAt the end of Rebellion, after Homura has rebelled and created the Homuverse where everyone can have their desires for love and friendship fulfilled, after the end credits, we see Homura in a field, holding her new soul gem and dancing around a mangy, scruffy, miserable-looking Kyuubei.\n\n\n\nAs the movie ends, the camera closes in on Kyuubei's face, and we see its eyes seem to be ringed with the same black field as the witches' curses.\n\n\nWhat exactly is going on here? It seems clear that Homura is torturing Kyuubei for its many crimes, but what exactly is she doing?\n", "post_id": "21024", "cluster_id": 696, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
