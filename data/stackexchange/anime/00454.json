{"body_text": "Can a death note have multiple owners? In episode 23/24, Light killed Higuchi to become the owner of his Death Note. It was important that he hold the Death Note so that he wouldn't lose his memory again. After he killed Higuchi, he became the new owner of the Death Note, because he touched the Death Note in the moment Higuchi died.\nNow, here's my question. If Light and L both touched the Death Note at the same time Higuchi died, would this notebook have two owners (in this case both Light and L)?\n", "post_id": "14310", "cluster_id": 454, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Can someone own multiple death notes? I know from this question that a death note could only belong to one person at a time, but I was wondering if the opposite was true--that one person could own multiple death notes. Could, say, that person go around killing the owners of death notes and stealing them in an effort to do something like own all of the death notes?\n", "post_id": "14338", "cluster_id": 454, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
