{"body_text": "Why can't The Dwarf leave the flask? The Dwarf in the Flask, of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, is seen trapped within a flask during his first appearance.\nAt one point in the series, The Dwarf states that his greatest wish is to leave the flask (from FMA Wikia):\n\n Being a homunculus with no form, the Dwarf in the Flask was unable to perform any alchemy of his own. Furthermore, though the flask was the only thing that keeps him alive, [The Dwarf] desired to exist outside it.\n\nHowever, due to the emboldened part above, it appears the flask is somehow keeping him alive (though he is only corked inside it). How does it do this, and how would he die if he left?\n", "post_id": "811", "cluster_id": 146, "novelty": true, "order": 0}

After rewatching most of FMA: Brotherhood, I'm a bit confused.\nIn Episode 40, Van Hohenheim explained that he's a humanoid form of the Philosopher's Stone. What difference does it make from the main Homunculi (Pride, Wrath, Envy, Gluttony, Lust, and the others) who use it only as an energy source?\nFor example, Wrath was a regular human being before he got the Stone, compared to Hohenheim who is the Stone itself. What are they different in?\nAlso, is Father the same? Since he was a Homunculus too (or whatever, I'm not even sure...), but he got the same \"reward\" in Xerxes as Hohenheim.\nSo, what's the difference between Father, Van Hohenheim, and the Homunculi? \n", "post_id": "5628", "cluster_id": 146, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
