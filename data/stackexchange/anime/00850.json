{"body_text": "Why does anime air in 4 seasons per year of ~13 episodes? Most likely, the actual seasons are not a cause for the television broadcasting schedule in Japan. Furthermore, the seasons themselves don't much align to actual seasons, with \"Spring 2015\" ending in late June.\nIt seems strange to me that series air in such regular intervals and with such consistent lengths (only deviating by perhaps 2 episodes from what I've seen).\nFurthermore, I'm no expert on western television, but it seems to me that western shows don't adhere to such a rigid schedule.\nNotably, it seems that season lengths have changed in anime over the years, too. For instance, the original season of Naruto had 35 episodes, which is something I don't think would happen these days.\nIs there a specific reason for this schedule? (cultural or otherwise)\n", "post_id": "22477", "cluster_id": 850, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Why don't more video games get full anime adaptations? In this definition of \"video game\", I am purposely excluding visual novels. By \"video game\", I generally mean anything you can play on a console (e.g. Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy, Kingdom Hearts, Fire Emblem, etc...).\nSo most anime that airs each season is adapted from some form of source material, like a manga, a light novel, or a visual novel. Why aren't video games adapted as often? Sure, there are a few out there (Valkyria Chronicles, MapleStory, Devil May Cry, and of course Pokemon, to name a few), but overall, anime adapted from games tend to be much less frequent than those adapted from LNs or VNs. \nWhy is this? Why don't bigger title games (like the aforementioned Chrono Trigger or one of the many Final Fantasy games) get full-length anime adaptations? (I'm also not counting those small OVAs or side story series that have nothing to do with the actual in-game story either). \n", "post_id": "22559", "cluster_id": 850, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
