{"body_text": "Regarding Shirou and Kiritsugu's attempt to destroy the grail So, I just finished Fate/Zero, and since Fate/stay night happened, clearly Kiritsugu was unable to destroy the grail to end the cycle (as I understand his intentions to be).  However, it seems like Shirou and Saber did the same thing, but this time without the massive devastation, and it seems like maybe he succeeded.\nWhy did Shirou succeed while Kiritsugu failed?\nI would also appreciate any links to resources to better my understanding of the Fate universe regarding the animes' endings.\n", "post_id": "13911", "cluster_id": 526, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Why was the Fifth Holy Grail War so early? I'm watching Fate/Zero, and it talks about how the Holy Grail Wars are supposed to be every 60 years. However, it's set in the 1990s, and the Fifth Holy Grail War takes place in the 2000s. Why were there only 10 years(ish) in between instead of 60? Is this explained in Fate/Stay Night or any of the other Fate stories?\n", "post_id": "16797", "cluster_id": 526, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
