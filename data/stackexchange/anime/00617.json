{"body_text": "Is the Fruit of Grisaia an actual fruit? Having played a fair bit of -LE FRUIT DE LA GRISAIA- (Grisaia no Kajitsu, literally \"The Fruit of Grisaia\"), I have to admit that the title has confused me more than anything else. It seems to have very little to do with the plot of the VN, at least so far.\nWhat is the meaning of the title? Is it titled after an actual fruit, and if so what is the fruit? Also, what significance does it have to the plot?\n", "post_id": "3139", "cluster_id": 617, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Why is Toradora's ED about oranges? This site has Toradora's second ending theme, Orange (\u30aa\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8), together with lyrics both in Japanese and translated.\nFirst, it's worth noting that the word Orange is ambiguous in English, referring both to a color and a fruit, and it is used to this effect in the song. At one point in the song it talks about a fruit which is turning orange, and at another it talks about an orange. I don't know if we can conclude that these are the same fruit, so if you want to claim that they are actually different fruits feel free to do so.\nWhat is the significance of this fruit, and the story told in the song in general, in the context of the anime? It seems to be symbolic somehow, but I don't know what it's referring to when the singer is talking about an \"orange ...[which] was sour, ... [but they] ate it all anyway.\" \nCan anyone decode the meaning of this song, and what the orange is symbolizing, in the context of the anime?\n", "post_id": "3135", "cluster_id": 617, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
