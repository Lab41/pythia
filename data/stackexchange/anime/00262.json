{"body_text": "What is the meaning of the phrase at the end of the last Cowboy Bebop episode? At the end of each Cowboy Bebop, there is a phrase (or a title card, as the Cowboy Bebop Wiki calls them). In most of the sessions, the phrase reads \"See You space cowboy...\".\n\nHowever, there are some variations:  \n\nSession 3: \"Easy Come, Easy Go...\" - It is (most likely) a reference to how easy it is to win and lose money in a casino, since this episode takes place in one.  \nSession 11: \"The End\" - I actually don't know if this is a reference, or simply a classic 'The End'.\nSession 12: \"To Be Continued \" - It simply states the fact that this episode is a Part 1, and the story is to be continued in the next session.  \nSession 13: \"Do You Have a comrade? \" - It is a reference to:  \n\n the relationship that Gren had with Vicious, and the fact that Spike helps him in the end.  \n\nSession 25: \"To Be Continued \" - Again, simply a reference to the fact that this episode is a Part 1, and the story is to be continued in the next session.  \nSession 26: \"You're gonna carry that weight.\" - ???\n\n\nSo, what is the meaning of such a phrase, at the end of the last session? Does the author have some message that he wants to pass with this phrase? Or is it simply a reference to the eponymous Beatles' song? \n", "post_id": "340", "cluster_id": 262, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
