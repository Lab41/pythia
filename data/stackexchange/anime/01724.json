{"body_text": "How to summarize the whole SAO, Sword Art Online, franchise? So yesterday I way talking to my mom about SAO. I'm really bad at explaining stuff so I think I might have confused her when I was talking about it. I was also jumping around from the story. For example I was talking about the beginning then went to the end, then to the middle, back to the end, then back to the beginning. After struggling to explain it to her I tried to summarizing it, but I'm also bad at that so I had a hard time doing that too.\nCan someone please summarize it for me like that I can explain it better to my mom. I told her the main point of the first season, Sword Art Online 1, which was that people got stuck in a game and to get out they had to clear out levels. I also told her that if you die in the game you die in real life. I pretty much told her the main point of the the first season, but didn't get that into the second one.\n", "post_id": "31028", "cluster_id": 1724, "novelty": true, "order": 0}

Ms. Steel's comment on my answer made me curious.\nWhy do people not directly exposed to anime tend to think of it as weird porn?\nIt would not be the first time I tell somebody who is not really into anime that I watch it and get questioned as to why I watch animated pornography. Until the point I confront them with the fact that Dragon Ball and Pok\u00e9mon are also animes. \nIt also does not seem to be a Western culture thing, as several people I know in India, America, Russia also tend to respond in the same way. \nIs there a specific reason as to why this stereotyping came to be?\n", "post_id": "31063", "cluster_id": 1724, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
