{"body_text": "Can the Tailed Beasts' relative power levels be compared? A Tailed Beast's power seems to be greater the more tails it has. For example:\n\nPower of 3-Tailed Beast = Power of 2-Tails + 1-Tails.\nPower of 9-Tailed Beast = Power of 8-Tails + 7-Tails + ... + 1-Tails.\n\nThis is clear. But is it possible to compare the power level of the 1-Tails and 2-Tails with this equation? Does the power of the 2-Tailed Beast = the power of the 1-Tailed one? Or is it greater?\nReference links:\n\nMost of them have shared the same idea in this link.\nBadranious's answer in this thread.\n\n", "post_id": "1940", "cluster_id": 18, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Is the Nine Tails still stronger than the Eight Tails even though half of him was sealed away? I've not read the manga series, so the question may be quite basic. \nIn an earlier discussion, it was said that the number of tails determines the power of the tailed beast. Since half the Nine-tail's chakra was sealed by the Fourth Hokage, does it mean that the Eight-tails now has more chakra than the Nine-tails?\n", "post_id": "2057", "cluster_id": 18, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
