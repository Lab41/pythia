{"body_text": "Where to continue after Berserk's movies A while back I have watched all three of the Berserk movies. Since I really enjoyed them, I decided to start watching the anime as well. \nThe anime however, starts a while after the events in the movies since Guts already has his mark. Reading the berserk wiki, it states that a lot of events are missing in the anime.\nNow, since I especially care about Berserk's storyline, I was wondering if I should start watching the Anime from start to end, jump in a few episodes of the Anime to get the chronological order right, or skip the anime all together and just read the manga?\nThanks in advance for the help. If I have been unclear, please leave a comment.\n", "post_id": "22675", "cluster_id": 863, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
