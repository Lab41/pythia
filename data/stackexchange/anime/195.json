I need to know what anime series/movies I saw a while back. It had what looked like a forest like setting I think. I can barely remember one scene where the two main characters were holding each other (a boy and a girl) on what was a little grassy (?) mound in the middle of a lake, and the virus was swirling all around them - or it might have been a spirit or something, because the smoke like \"virus\" moved on its own (all I know was that it was black and like smoke). I think that both the kids had the virus but I don't remember. It might have been an early anime, but I think I remember watching it some time in the early 2000's or so (2000-2008).\n"}
