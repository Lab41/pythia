Then I remember that eating Two Devil Fruits = your body to explode. \nSo.. I was thinking, What would have been the Result if Brook (Alive) would have died by eating a second Devil Fruit? Would his Yomi Yomi no Mi powers activate and revive him and if so, he is a person that was able to eat two devil fruit and live which means, two abilities? \n", "post_id": "26687", "cluster_id": 1230, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
