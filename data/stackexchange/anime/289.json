I would like to point out this incident from NHK ni Youkoso - Episode 21 (11:12 to 11:34).\nThe main character Sato is escorting his friend Yamazaki to a subway station to bid final adieu to him. Yamazaki is a game creator (gal games) and MC helps him to create one. I have written below a short piece of dialogue (writing it from the English subtitles) between the two at the subway station:\n\nSato: Sorry\nYamazaki: If you visit home, be absolutely sure you get in touch\nSato: Sure..\nYamazaki: See you around.\nSato (a bit panicked): Yamazaki..\nYamazaki: Don't let the world beat you, Sato\nSato (this main character seems even more panicked and shouts in Japanese): You are not going home defeated, right?!\nYamazaki chuckles.\n  ...\n  ..\n\nNow my question to all the fellow members is, why does the character shout here? It seems a bit awkwardly and reluctantly placed. This is one instance which I have cited here but I have seen this sort of thing in other animes before. I can't exactly remember the names.\n"}
