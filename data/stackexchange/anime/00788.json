{"body_text": "In what order were the Servants summoned for the 5th Holy Grail War? I know that Assassin was summoned after Caster, and in most cases, Saber is the last Servant to be summoned. (The exception is in Heaven's Feel if you count True Assassin's appearance as a separate summoning).\nHowever, I am wondering about the order of summoning of all the Servants, and if possible, the approximate times in which they were summoned.\nIn the visual novel, the date is shown during cutscenes, and I am quite sure that Saber was summoned on the night of 29th of February 2004, as I remember that the date changed from 29/2 into 1/3 after Shirou returned home with Saber. This can be used to approximate when the Servants were summoned.\n", "post_id": "22081", "cluster_id": 788, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "In what order were the Servants summoned for the 4th Holy Grail War? Similar to this question, but focusing only on the Servants of the 4th Holy Grail War featured in Fate/Zero.\nLikewise, it would be also be good to list when the Servants were summoned if possible, though I am unsure if there was any date notation of any Servant's summoning to use as an approximation unlike that of Saber's summoning in Fate/Stay Night.\n", "post_id": "22082", "cluster_id": 788, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
