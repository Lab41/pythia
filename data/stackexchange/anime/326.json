Anyway, they only have under 4 or so episodes but I totally forgot the title of it and I wanted to check if they have a manga version that i could read. It's been bugging me for days and I really want to know it's title. I'll try to explain as much as I can what the anime/episodes were about.\nThe anime is kind of like a puzzle/ riddle type of anime that involves the main characters having to solve the type of game they are currently playing in order to get back to the real world. One of the characteristic of the main guy was that he is really good at noticing/analysing detailed stuff when he is put in a high pressure situation. It sounds like that anime Phi Brain or Btooom, but it's different. \n\u2022The first episode revolved around 3 highschool students that were just living their day to day life and then suddenly they were transported into a game/or a different world where there are no adults that would tell them what to do. They took this chance to roam around town, getting drunk and doing nothing but just playing around for days/weeks until they suddenly realised that this shits weird. How come nobody is around? where is everybody? Anyway, they found out that they're not the only one in this world. They meet a girl that's been playing this game for a while and explained them their situation. Somehow, one  of the highschool students activated a game and they have to follow the rules in order to finish it. They could actually get killed in these games. They were somehow able to solve the riddle and was able to get back. One of the scenes I remember near the last minutes of episode 1 was thousands of fire arrows started raining down on them and they have to decide and figure out which direction they have to go to avoid the barrage of arrows\n\u2022I think the 2nd or 3rd episode, they wanted to play another game to know more about it. But this time its a little bit different. They're in a complex/apartment building with different people/ players and they have to play Hide & Seek/or was it Tag? Anyway, they have limited amount of time but they basically need to find the room that has the button that they need to press in order to finish the game. The trick is not to get caught/tagged by the guy chasing them around that was holding a gun and machete that would totally kill them.\nThat's all i got, I hope one of ya'll know what this anime is.\n"}

Then suddenly they had been teleported to abandoned city. They went to explore what is going on. When they ware wondering, they met women. After that they all together reach temple. In the temple game of death started. They all had to draw card with question. The answer- number. And if you guest wrong the temple are bombarded with fire arrows (arrow count is difference between correct answer and wrong answer). Finally MC (one of the guys) figured it out and escaped temple. Although his friend was shot with arrow in the leg. After then (or maybe later), someone explained all situation. That they must participate in those death games. And if they win, they can live X days more. Otherwise satellite will kill you (if you run out of time). MC was quit exited, so he suggested to participate in another game. His friend was injured, so he went with that women. The next game was in multistory building. There was about 5 levels with a lot of rooms. And outside stairs and balconies connected to each room. There were a lot of participants and all of them had to find room with red button. They they press it, they will win. Although there was walking a tough guy with MAC smg. And killing everyone.\n\nSome information can be inaccurate. I watched this anime long\n  time ago and I remember it poorly.\n\nOkay, I think that is enough story. Please help me find this anime. Thanks.\n"}
