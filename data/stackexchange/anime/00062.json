There are several similarities between the two characters and also the characters they interact with.\n\nThey are both extremely skilled swordsmen.\nTheir names/titles are slightly similar and hint at being swordsmen. I'm not entirely sure about Roronoa but Kenshin's name was derived from some samurai novel. Also, vaguely note how execution is a main topic in and is constantly mentioned in One Piece and the character Kenshin was based on a samurai who was executed.\nKenshin was released in 1996 and One Piece came later in 1999.\n\nFrom ANN's plot summary of Rurouni Kenshin\nSo I would like to ask, is there any source that confirms whether the character Roronoa Zoro from One Piece is related in any way to Kenshin, or whether One Piece is somewhat influenced by Kenshin?\n", "post_id": "3470", "cluster_id": 62, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
