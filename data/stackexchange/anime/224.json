I know that yaoi is famous for its fangirls, but I was wondering what the case was for yuri.\nI have only occasionally seen yuri fangirls being referenced in anime, and these shows have a cast that is fully female.\n\nInspiration!\nResearching it, there seems to be many subcategorys of yuri, which are targetted towards men, women and younger girls. But I was wondering - which is the main target audience for this genre?\n"}
