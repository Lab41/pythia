I've noticed a recurring design in anime, manga, and other Japanese art and I'm wondering where it comes from. It's basically a jet-like machine or creature with a pointed head, tufted \"ears\", long neck, and sharp wings attached to a back-heavy body. Here's some examples:\nThe Gekko from Eureka Seven:\n\nLatias/Latios from Pok\u00e9mon:\n\nChiara Toscana's weapon/vehicle from Shakugan no Shana:\n\nAre these simply coincidences or is it a design trope, similar to something like mecha? Is there more history behind this shape? If you know of any other examples, I'd love to know about them.\n"}
