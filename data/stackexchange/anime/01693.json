{"body_text": "Why did Itachi's amaterasu not burn the entire inn? In the original Naruto series there is a confrontation between Jiraiya and Itachi. Jiraiya tries to stop Itachi from escaping by trapping him and Kisame inside the stomach of a toad. Itachi was able to escape the stomach by burning a hole through to the other side using amaterasu. \nThe flames produced by amaterasu are supposed to burn for seven days and seven nights. Also, the flames cannot be extinguished with water. \nSo, my question is why was the inn they were in not destroyed? The flames should have spread and burned the entire inn. \n", "post_id": "29526", "cluster_id": 1693, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Is it possible to seal Opponent Ninjutsu by using scroll? After seeing naruto series we have seen different scroll of various sizes which are used to summon something or to do something related seal.\nIn Boruto: Naruto the movie, Konohamaru used Rasengan and sealed that in the scroll. So by that sealing Ninjutsu is possible.\nSo my question is that, is it possible for someone to seal enemy Ninjutsu on scroll.\nFor example\nNaruto used Rasengan and throws it towards his enemy.\nSo is it possible for enemy to seal that Rasengan simply by opening scroll wide enough so that it can strike right through it and then get absorbed. I mean by that enemy can seal Rasengan again and again. So is it possible ?\n\n", "post_id": "30509", "cluster_id": 1693, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
