{"body_text": "Chakra nature of Tailed beasts As we all know that Kurama's chakra is of the healing nature type. This is known from many mentions about it in the wiki page of Naruto Uzumaki.\nMy question is, what is the nature type of the chakra of the other Tailed beasts?\nNote: This is my thinking why there should have been a nature type to each of the tailed beasts. \nAs we all know that when Rikud\u014d Sennin was about to die, he split his powers among his 2 sons(The older son inherited his powerful chakra and spiritual energy & the younger son inherited his powerful life force and physical energy). Similarly, when creating the 9 tailed beasts from the Shinju, he must have split the chakra based on their nature so that each tailed beasts had a unique natured chakra.\nAny insights on this would be very much welcomed.\n", "post_id": "5671", "cluster_id": 155, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Relationship of Yin-Yang in Five Chakra nature elements After reading this question about Chakra nature of Tailed beasts. It came across my mind what is the relationship of the Yin-yang to the 5 Chakra nature elements? And how come you can classify a Chakra nature as Yin-Yang? Does it has something to do with the Chinese Zodiac or principles of Taoism?\n", "post_id": "5716", "cluster_id": 155, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
