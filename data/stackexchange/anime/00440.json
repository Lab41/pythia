{"body_text": "When did the Soul Eater anime and manga diverge? From what I've heard, the anime version of Soul Eater was fairly faithful to the manga up to a certain point (excluding a few fillers). However, the ending of the anime was nothing like the manga (which is still ongoing), and in my view the end of the anime was its weakest point. I want to start reading the manga at the point where the two diverged.\nWhat is the last manga chapter that was adapted in the anime, and what episode does that correspond to? Also, are there any chapters before that which I would have missed from the anime (especially those which have important plot points)?\n", "post_id": "2642", "cluster_id": 440, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
