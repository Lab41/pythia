{"body_text": "How long was Saber waiting for Shirou after she died? Regarding the question that was asked before:\nDo Emiya Shirou and Arturia ever meet again after Fate/stay night? \nObviously if it took them an eternity to meet, it's common sense that it never happened.  \nSo my theory is that there are two options for this occasion:  \n\nThe author's definition of eternity is something different from what is known to the public.\nThat it was some sort of an inside joke to troll the audience who desperately want to see them reunite.\n\nIs there any official statement about how long eternity is according to the Fate Stay/Night series?\nAre there even any clues on which to base some sort of speculation on the matter?\nOr maybe the light novel perhaps mentions something about it.  \nI really want to know how much Saber had to suffer in order to finally meet with Shirou.\n(IMO after all she's been through, she has suffered quite enough already). \n", "post_id": "15335", "cluster_id": 494, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
