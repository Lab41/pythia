{"body_text": "What constitutes as an Yin/Yang/Yinyang element technique? As we know, the Naruto \"Table of the elements\" consists of more than just the basic 5.\nIn addition to all of the combination elements, (Wood, Ice, etc), we also have the three rather bizarre Yin, Yang, and YinYang elements.\nWhat are they? What can they do? Tobi explained that mastery over these elements allows one to basically become God, completely erasing the boundary between dream and reality. However, is that all there is to it?\nThe Second Mizukage states that genjutsu is basically Yin element, what does that make the Yang element?\nAlso, what is the YinYang element?
