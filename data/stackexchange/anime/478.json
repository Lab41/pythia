I\u2019ve watched Chobits years ago and was curious.\nThe first episode/chapter tells us about how Hideki found Chii in the dumpster.\nAccording to the plot description in the Wikipedia article Chobits (bold emphasis mine):\n\nThe series centers on the life of Hideki Motosuwa, a held-back student attempting to qualify for university by studying at Seki prep school in Tokyo. Besides a girlfriend, he dreams of having a persocom (\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3?): an android used as a personal computer, which is expensive. On his way home one evening, he stumbles across a persocom in the form of a beautiful girl with floor-length hair lying against a pile of trash bags, and he carries her home, not noticing that a disk fell on the ground. Upon turning her on, she instantly regards Hideki with adoration. The only word the persocom seems capable of saying is \"chi\" (\u3061\u3043 Chii?), thus he names her that.\n\nWhat does the disk contain?\n"}

As mentioned in this question, I am wondering why the writer or the creator of the anime Chobits didn't reveal a crucial thing such as the contents of the disk in question.\nAccording to this answer, the manga revealed the contents of the disk in the late chapters. Why did they not do so in the anime?\nAs I am not very familiar with finding writer's or creator's comments on their works, I am having a hard time understanding this.\nAny reference linked to the subject matter or facts referring to the creation of this anime is very much appreciated.\n"}
