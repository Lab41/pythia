So, to my understanding, the idea of alchemy is equivalent exchange, in which you get in return as much as you gave.\nThis doesn't make sense to me, as in the beginning when they tried to transmute their mother back, Alphonse lost everything, and Edward lost his leg. They didn't get anything in return, or at least anything worth of a soul and a body. After this Edward transmuted his arm to get Alphonse back.\nSo, put in a calculation:\nThings lost\n\nRandom piled ingredients which were supposed to compose the average human\nAlphonse's body\nAlphonse's soul\nEdward's arm\nEdward's leg\n\nThings gained\n\nA blob of purple stuff with Alphonse's soul affixed to it ( for a while )\nAlphonse's soul\n\nSo, where the hell did the rest of the stuff go?
