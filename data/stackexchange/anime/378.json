I've rewatched Rebuild of Evangelion: 1.01: You can (not) advance, and something struck me.\nAt the very end (so spoiler):\n\nKaworu is on the moon, looking at Shinji, and say \"You're the third again, Shinji\"\n\nIs the \"again\" a sign that what happened in NGE/EoE in the same continuity? Or does it link with RoE 3/4 (which I've still to see)?\n"}

OK so the other day I got to a discussion with my mate about the Remake of Evangelion and Evangelion in general. And he seams to be under the impression that the new Evangelion movies are not actually a remake but a sequel.  And he does have good arguments backing it.\nThe idea being that the \"Evengelion 1.0 You are not alone\" world is the world that Shinji created at the end of \"The End of Evangelion\". If you think about it it does fit. One of the biggest hints for this is the same red sea seen with what the \"The End of Evangelion\" ends and \"Evangelion 1.0\" begins. More to the point, if you remember the original series, then there the sea was blue and in the remake it's red and if you think about the big differences than it does make seance.\nBut I just do not know, I kinda am convinced, but at the same time... are they really trolling with us? Kinda hard to believe, I would love to give counter arguments, but can't really think of any, because he is claiming that the world that was created by Shinji was almost identical but with some minor differences. \n"}
