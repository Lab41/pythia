{"body_text": "What are the steps involved in making a professional manga? I've been watching Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun and I was surprised at the range of different things that were involved in the process of making a manga - like inking and cutting out sparkles to stick on the pages.\n\nNozaki-kun also has a load of different numbered pens on his desk. I presume at least one of them is a \"G-Pen\", which I have heard a lot of, but am not entirely sure what it is... and there are things that look like film canisters...\n\nI was hoping A&M could help to explain the steps and tools that mangakas go through when making their manga and ideally, the order of those steps as well.\nNote: I'm not asking for how I can do it myself, just the process that they go through on a high level.\n", "post_id": "13620", "cluster_id": 648, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Why is anime produced faster than manga? Anime is colorful. It has voice and music. It contains tens of thousands of frames. It requires advanced computer software and high level of technology.\nOn the other hand, manga is nothing but a drawing with pen and pencil.\nI would expect manga to be produced faster than anime under these conditions. However, it appears to be not the case. In most long running series, anime eventually catches up to the manga.\nIs it because the mangakas are lazy, or is there another reason behind this?\n", "post_id": "19930", "cluster_id": 648, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
