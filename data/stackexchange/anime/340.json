I've been watching Inuyasha with subtitles and in episode 6 and 7, Inuyasha fights with his brother Sesshomaru about a sword. The English subtitle says \"Tetsusaiga\" but they're clearly saying \"\u3066\u3063\u3055\u3044\u304c\". Why are they subtitling it in this way?\n"}

Previously I though that sama was for equal or higher rank shinobi's \nand kun was for junior rank Shinobi's.\nFor example -\nYamato called Kakashi as Kakashi-sama, whereas Naruto as Naruto-kun.\nBut I noticed that I might be wrong as Hinata too called Naruto as Naruto-kun. \nSo what's the actual meaning of Sama and Kun?\nI found some answers here. But can anyone explain this with respect to the anime?\n"}

Although this question might be a naive thing to ask, I believe that I would get an much detailed answer to this question keeping in mind all my simple questions answered wonderfully by people in the past. I read the wiki page on Tsundere but there's not much, I understand the broad definition where a person has a combative attitude towards a particular protagonist in any anime. What I am looking for, is an all-encompassing criteria/concept of a 'tsundere' and the highlights of their social behavior.\n"}
