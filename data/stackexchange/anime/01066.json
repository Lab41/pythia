{"body_text": "Why are there so many fillers in long-running animes? The most obvious answer everyone over the Internet is giving to this question is \"Because anime is produced much faster compared to manga, they need to put in fillers in order to slow down the anime series\". However, that shouldn't be the only reason.\nFor example, consider One Piece. The show is going on for more than 500 episodes, and less than 10% are fillers. Comparing that to Naruto, the show has almost the same number of episodes (original and Shippuuden combined), but almost 50% of its episodes are fillers. Needless to say, the manga of Naruto is so far ahead that the anime won't be able to catch up even if they produce 100+ episodes without any fillers. \n", "post_id": "336", "cluster_id": 1066, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Why make filler episodes? The general rule seems to be that filler is made when an anime is being produced faster than the manga. The thing I just can't seem to figure out is\n\nHow an entire freaking episode takes longer to produce than a manga which practically only equals a story board.\nWhy would they start producing random filler rather than just overtaking the manga with their own story.\n\nI mean, is this some Japanese cultural thing where a lot of credit is given to the author of the manga and he isn't allowed to collaborate with others to speed up production or is this a cultural thing where Japanese actually like those fillers or what? After all, there are a lot of economic incentives not to produce filler episodes as they tend to irritate fans a lot and still cost a lot to produce.\n", "post_id": "24283", "cluster_id": 1066, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
