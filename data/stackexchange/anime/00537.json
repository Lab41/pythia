{"body_text": "Who applies censorship on an ecchi anime? In my few years of watching anime, I have noticed varied amounts of ecchi-ness portrayed and the corresponding censorship it generates. I mentioned \"varied\" because I have noted differences in censorship techniques (black/white bars, excessive lighting) and the amount dealt to the scene. For instance most non-ecchi anime have the breasts censored, some only have the nipples removed, and a quite a few bare them completely. The quite few who go the extremes may even be classified as hentai already.\nPoints in case (I wanted to include pics but then decided against it):\n\nPartial covers: Gokukoku no Brynhildr, Infinite Stratos, Trinity Seven\nBared completely: HighSchool DxD, Yosuga no Sora, Elfen Lied\n\nMy question: How does Japan implement various levels of content ratings (G, PG, R18+)?  Is it the production studio who applies these varying amount of censorship or is there a committee assigned that does it? Does the same apply for violence/gore censorship?\n", "post_id": "16885", "cluster_id": 537, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
