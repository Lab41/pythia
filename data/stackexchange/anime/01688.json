{"body_text": "Why is dubbed anime commercially considered a \"premium\"? You can easily, and legally, stream anime for free from services like Crunchyroll, Hulu, directly from the licensing companies (such as from Funimation), and whatnot.\nBut the catch to that free access to the content is that it is subbed, not dubbed; you have to pay an actual fee if you want to watch the anime dubbed.\nWhy is dubbed anime considered a \"premium\" that you have to pay for?\nI ask this because a fairly substantial amount of the anime fan population actually prefer to watch subbed anime anyways, even to the point of inciting some ridiculous subbed vs dubbed arguments in Youtube comments sections and other internet forums...\nWhy charge for just dubbed anime when you can also charge for subbed as well?
