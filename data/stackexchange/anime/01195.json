{"body_text": "Can the Titans swim? I have only seen the anime and haven't read the manga, but a question came to me:\nCan the titans swim?\nWe know that they are abnormally light and strong for their size. However, the fact that they evaporate after dying kind of suggests that they are formed of some sort of compact water vapor, so should we expect them to melt when they come into contact with water? It's not like they disappear when it rains... Or maybe they can't swim because they're too stupid\nBecause, if they can't, this place in Paris could've been a possibility for humanity.\n\nFrom http://www.parisetudiant.com/etudiant/sortie/l-ile-seguin-et-les-berges-de-la-seine-boulogne-billancourt.html\n", "post_id": "13446", "cluster_id": 1195, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "In Attack on Titan, how did the river barge escape Shiganshina in episode 2? In episode 2 of the anime, the characters start off in the Shiganshina district.  When and how did they get inside wall Maria?  It shows them on a river barge with other refugees, but I do not think that explains it.  Is there a gate on the river for the barge to go through?  If so, is the gate ever shown, explained or attacked?\n", "post_id": "26331", "cluster_id": 1195, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
