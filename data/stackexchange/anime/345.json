In Shingeki no Kyojin, Armin's grandfather dies when he is sent to recover Wall Maria.

In chapter 10, during Eren's flashback, Eren's father gave him a key and told him to embrace the power of Titan transformation if he wanted to protect Mikasa and Armin. His father said that the key is for the basement under their home in Wall Maria where all the secrets would be revealed. I wonder if it's already been revealed in the manga. If it has been revealed, can anybody explain it?\n"}
