When a body part is taken from a dead body, it can never get that back.\nBut in naruto many reanimated ninja's had lost their eye of some or the other reason. (Sharingan, rinnegan and byakugan mainly). As far as i know, sasuke has taken itachi's eyes to awaken his powers.\nSo then how could itachi get his sharingan back when kabuto reanimated him?\nIs there any kind of logic behind this which I've missed out?\nOr is that some law in the shinobi world?\nObito had taken over Nagato's rinnegan, yet nagato had the rinnegan when he was reanimated.\nConsidering the power of rinnegan which creates stuff, there hasn't been any scene where sharingan and other eyes of rinnegan were created and transplanted into itachi and nagato.\n", "post_id": "5745", "cluster_id": 157, "novelty": false, "order": 1}
