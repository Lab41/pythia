{"body_text": "What is the chorus singing during the opening of Ookami Kakushi? The opening song of the Ookami Kakushi anime, Toki no Mukou Maboroshi no Sora, has a chorus intro where I cannot distinguish what they are singing. It could be Japanese or Latin. The lyrics sites only have the main singer lyrics, not the chorus. At least the ones I found. Does anyone know what language is the chorus singing in?\nFor reference, here is the Wikipedia link to the song. The chorus in question is sung in two moments, at the beginning (0:00\u20130:05 one time) and later on (3:38\u20133:50 repeated twice). The 3:38 section is only available in the full version, which was DMCA'ed into oblivion. Vimeo has the TV-sized version, though.\n", "post_id": "6716", "cluster_id": 319, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
