I finished watching the second season of Darker than Black: Gemini of the Meteor, and seeing how it ended it seems like there may be a continuation since there are some questions left unanswered at the end:\n\n 1) Amber seemed to have wanted Hei to know the prophecy so did she wanted Hei to seal Hell's Gate in Season 1 solely to prevent it\n 2) Yin says for Hei to \"Take her Life\", since Hei's Powers are actually Pi's because she fused with him (her power being able to manipulate matter at the atomic level apparently) and Hei was only seen with his hand outreach at the end so is Yin now fused with Hei like Pi\n 3) Those 2 Doll Twins had the same kind of Specter that Yin had where instead of a blob they had a human from and they said they was going to a 3rd gate that has just appeared so what is the 3rd gate and why has it appeared after the first 2\n 4) There's the unknown being that would be born which is probably that child that came out of the coffin but also there's a huge black monolith extending out of Hell's Gate so does it has a connection to the kid\n\nI'm wondering if there is a continuation and what form it is in (anime or manga). Since most anime are adaptations of manga, does a manga continuation already exists? And if so, are there any plans to adapt it into an anime?\n"}
