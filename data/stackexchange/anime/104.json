Since beginning of the anime, when he fought Zabuza, he used his Sharingan, and he was out for around one week due to overuse. However, two years later, he's able to use the Kamui often.\nHow he was able to master the Sharingan in those two years, when he's had it for about decade?\n"}

The Ninjas from the other countries call Kakashi the Copy Cat Ninja because of his Sharingan and how he uses it for his advantage (Copying moves). But he does not use his power to copy very often (or at least not anymore). It is only shown around 3-4 times that he actually copies and uses it against somebody.\nWhy does he not use this power more often?\n"}
