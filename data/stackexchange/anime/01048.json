{"body_text": "Why does anime air in 4 seasons per year of ~13 episodes? Most likely, the actual seasons are not a cause for the television broadcasting schedule in Japan. Furthermore, the seasons themselves don't much align to actual seasons, with \"Spring 2015\" ending in late June.\nIt seems strange to me that series air in such regular intervals and with such consistent lengths (only deviating by perhaps 2 episodes from what I've seen).\nFurthermore, I'm no expert on western television, but it seems to me that western shows don't adhere to such a rigid schedule.\nNotably, it seems that season lengths have changed in anime over the years, too. For instance, the original season of Naruto had 35 episodes, which is something I don't think would happen these days.\nIs there a specific reason for this schedule? (cultural or otherwise)\n", "post_id": "22477", "cluster_id": 1048, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Why did they separate Fate/Zero and Fate/Stay Night UBW into two season Usually anime will be completed in a single season while second season is a sequel or prequel. But Fate/Stay Night UBW and Fate/Zero aired the first 12 episodes on first season and continued the next episode in the next season.
