Every villager in Konoha is aware that Naruto has the Kyuubi sealed inside of him.  \nIs anyone in the village or elsewhere (other than Kakashi and Jiraiya, that I remember knew) aware that he is the son of Minato and Kushina?\nMy main doubt being: do they know that he is the son of the Fourth Hokage?\n"}

Naruto was always discriminated against by the people of the Leaf Village because he had the Kyuubi inside. However, he is the son of the 4th Hokage and he was the one who sealed it inside him. Why, then, did they discriminate against him if it was in order to save the village?\n"}

I know that the villagers of Konoha were afraid of the Kyuubi because of its rampage on the village, and that the Fourth Hokage saved the village by sealing it inside Naruto. Based on this answer, the Third Hokage hid his identity to protect him. \nDid the Third Hokage hide only Naruto's relation with the Fourth, or also him being the Kyuubi jinchuriki? If so, did the villagers find out because Naruto went out of control with the Kyuubi's chakra? \nEdit:\nTo make clear what I am exactly curious about.\nWhy didn't they also hide Naruto's identity as a jinchuriki so the villagers will not hate him?\n"}
