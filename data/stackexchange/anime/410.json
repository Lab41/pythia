Recently got done watching the Skypiea Arc and it has just been bugging me constantly but in Episode 167 Usopp goes to the bathroom and sees someone fixing the Going Merry. No where else is this addressed in the Arc(at least anime wise) was Usopp really just seeing things because he was tired or was there really someone fixing their ship for them. Here is a picture of the scene I am talking about. \n\n"}
