Karatebu the word \"osu\" is used quite frequently, and from context I have so far assumed that it is a way for the junior members of the karate club to respond to their seniors in a general \"yes, sir\" way. However, I recently came across this panel which presents a quite different take on the word:\n\nWhat is the significance of Shingo's particular dialogue about \"osu?\" Is it a typical philosophy of the character, karate, or a mix of the two? Why is it so different from how it is used elsewhere in the manga?\n"}

Are there any examples of tsukkomi characters besides the one in the above-mentioned manga?\n"}
