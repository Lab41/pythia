I went back to the beginning of AoT in episode 1 and noticed these scenes that occurred at the beginning of the episode.

Were they some type of compressed/hidden memories? What was the farm house we saw? I am also pretty sure this wasn't in the anime but manga answers are welcome also. ;)\nNote: I couldn't find a video link to give but there is a animated GIF version of it that I made here. Also helpful but it is quite easy to see the scene if you want to since it occurs straight after the opening of AoT in episode 1.\n", "post_id": "13548", "cluster_id": 1235, "novelty": true, "order": 0}

Do you think that Eren can live in another world or subconsciousness? Is there any explanation for him seeing this dream?\n", "post_id": "26720", "cluster_id": 1235, "novelty": false, "order": 1}
