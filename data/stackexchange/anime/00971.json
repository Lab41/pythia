{"body_text": "What is the purpose of having this face in the subtitles/lyrics? During the first verse in the second opening to Hayate no Gotoku, this face (O_O;) appears in each version of the subtitles;  the translated, romanised and original Japanese versions.\nAdditionally, the face is also included on various lyrics sites such as here and here.\nWhy is this? I've never seen emoticons or unicode faces in any other subtitles, and I don't see how it adds to the song at all. I know this is a series that doesn't take itself too seriously, but is there any explanation as to why this is here?\n\nThe opening can be watched on YouTube here, with the part in question at around 0:32 to 0:35.\nFor anyone interested, the song itself is called Shichitenhakki Shijou Shugi! and is sung by KOTOKO.\n", "post_id": "23267", "cluster_id": 971, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "What were the contents of the letter that Kirika didn't want Shirabe to read? In the second Symphogear G \"Zesshoushinai\" special episode, the last segment (starting at around 12:48) has Shirabe showing Kirika a letter that had been confiscated from them after they were taken into custody. Kirika immediately snatches it away, hides it behind her back, and starts yelling rather incoherently (and cutely). \nWhat did the letter say? (My best guess is that it's probably something that Kirika wrote when she thought she was going to \"die\" as a result of being taken over by Fin\u00e9, but I'd like to know if this is touched on anywhere else.)\n", "post_id": "23477", "cluster_id": 971, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
