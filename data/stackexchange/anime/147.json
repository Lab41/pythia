All that I can remember for this anime is that it is a type of fantasy anime and the main character that the anime is mainly focused on is a man who is some special type of magician. \nIt starts off in some school for magicians or something and when they finish they got put into the army. But the main character ended up using his badass magic powers and ended up saving his friend who I believe is a prince and ends up being king and his friend who is a girl. After he has saved them I believe he ends up getting thrown into jail for it. Then he ends up traveling with some woman and that woman helps him not get taken over by his powers when he uses them. \nI remember that I saw this about a year ago on gogoanime and it was a full series - I think it was about 26 episodes long. I just really need helping finding out which anime this is.\n"}
