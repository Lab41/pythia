Did Nami undergo a breast operation by Chopper?  ;-)\n\nAll joking aside!\nHow could an 18 year old girl's breasts grow so large within 2 years? After the time skip, Luffy became 19 and Nami turned 20. I know that in the world of One Piece, everything is possible, but why did the producers change her breasts?\nThis cannot be a coincidence:\n\nFrom a comment on Facebook\n"}

I don't understand this image . \n\nIf you look at her headgear , you'll see that it's polished and has that clean shine. But what's up with the breasts? \nThe breast appear to be shining or they look polished just like her helmet. I don't watch One Piece. So I don't know if she has shiny breasts or she polishes it. Can someone please enlighten me ?\n"}
