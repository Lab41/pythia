{"body_text": "Why does Trafalgar D. Law use 'Ya-\u3084(\u5c4b)' suffix while addressing others? Using ~-san, ~-kun, ~-sama while addressing other people is common in Japanese culture.But Law uses ya as suffix while addressing people, like in the nicknames Strawhat-ya for Luffy and Blackleg-ya for Sanji, and in real names Zoro-ya, Nami-ya and Nico-ya.\nYa are translated as Mr. or Miss. in English. But in Japanese adding ya defines someone's profession. It is not that Law does not use ~-san at all, Like with Corazon and sarcastically with Vergo. As stated in this page.\nSo why does Law use ya rather then ~-san, ~-kun, etc. while addressing others?\n", "post_id": "22719", "cluster_id": 865, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
