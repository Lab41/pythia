Before Berg Katze went to fight OD Hajime asks him if later they can meet up somewhere. after everything has clamed down Berg Katze is trying to stir up trouble by shape shifting and attempting to get people to turn on each other using the Crowds however after that fails be leaves disappointed. \nAfter that Hajime is seen waiting for him where they agreed to meet before calling her mother, during which the scene is focused on her chest.\nAfter the credits when Hajime goes to leave there are shots focusing on her chest with sometimes tapping/pointing to herself. as she walks out she is announcing her plans before we hear Berg Katze reply acting all negative about it by saying it'll suck. \nThis answer confirms that is it Berg Katze that Hajime is talking to but I am wondering, what happened to him which cased him to now be with Hajime like this?\n"}
