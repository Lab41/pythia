{"body_text": "Was running into people with toast in your mouth already a cliche by Evangelion's time (1995-96)? As everyone who's seen Evangelion knows, the alternate-reality segment in the last episode (of the 1995 TV series) prominently features a scene where Rei, mouth entoasted, runs into Shinji on her way to school. \nTo those of us living in the year 2016, this is an obvious cliche; countless many anime have portrayed the same thing in the two decades since (episode 1 of Nichibros has my favorite rendition). But would viewers in 1995 have seen this as a cliche? \nIt seems plausible that Evangelion could have been using the toast-collision trope as a touchstone to really drive home the prototypical-slice-of-life nature of the alternate reality. But then again, it also seems plausible that the toast-collision was only an incidental feature of the segment, and that the trope's present-day status as a cliche is a consequence of other shows imitating Evangelion. I don't really have enough of a pre-Evangelion knowledge base to discern which is true.\n", "post_id": "30677", "cluster_id": 1709, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
