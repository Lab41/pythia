I haven't seen an anime before No Game No life that uses such vibrant colors before, and I thought that it might have been unique to it. However I recently watched A Dark Rabbit Has 7 Lives and it uses an extremely similar style of art, so now I'm wondering what the style is called so that I can look up more work with it.\n"}

Instead of having normal coloring/shading, different pieces (such as hair or a shirt) have their own pattern that doesn't move with the piece. You can see it in the Count's hair and in the shirt below. Is there a name for this type of art, and is this something that is unique to Gankutsuou or to anime?\n\n"}
