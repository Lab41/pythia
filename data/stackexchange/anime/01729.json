{"body_text": "By number of series, how much of the animation industry is made up by anime? Today a friend of mine proclaimed that around 70% of the world's cartoon animation entertainment consists of anime. So according to his statement, for every 3 non anime animation series, at least 7 anime series should exist.\nAfter looking through his proclaimed source wikipedia I could only find out that about 70% of DVD sales are made by anime, which sounds reasonable, but does not back up his 3 to 7 cartoon to anime series ratio at all.\nNow I know that anime is well-known, even around the world. But claiming that around 2/3 of all cartoon animation series is anime sounds a bit of an overkill to me. \nThis however made me wonder, what is the ratio of non anime cartoon series to cartoon series, or how much do anime series (roughly) make up of animation entertainment series overall?\nAlthough the first few animes were already observed as far back as 1907, anime really launched around 1960 after/during Astro Boy, and as new series are made just about everyday for both anime and non-anime alike, I would propose a time limit of 1960 till 2015.\nTL;DR\nWhat is the ratio of anime series versus non anime series?\n", "post_id": "31220", "cluster_id": 1729, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
