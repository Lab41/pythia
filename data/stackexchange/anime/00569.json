{"body_text": "Why did they air all four Tsukimonogatari episodes in one day? The most recent story of the Monogatari series, Tsukimonogatari, has just aired and has all of its four episodes aired on one day. The same thing happened with Hanamonogatari which aired on August 6, 2014. They aired all of its five episodes on that day.\nWhy did they do that? Why didn't they wait and air 9 episodes over multiple days, or maybe wait some more to make Monogatari Series: Third Season with Owarimonogatari and Zoku-Owarimonogatari? Why did they air all its episodes in one day? What's the point of making it have 4 or 5 episodes when it could also fit in a movie as well?\n", "post_id": "17272", "cluster_id": 569, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Why have they been delaying Kizumonogatari for so long? Kizumonogatari is a movie based on a story of the same name in Monogatari Series light novel, which is part of First Season before Nisemonogatari. I don't even remember when it was supposed to air, probably two or three years ago. After the delay, they kept producing other stories in Monogatari Series like Monogatari Series: Second Season, Hanamonogatari and Tsukimonogatari.\nWhy did they put it off for so long? If it was because of production issue, like Hanamonogatari, why did they keep producing another Monogatari Series but not Kizumonogatari?\n", "post_id": "18377", "cluster_id": 569, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
