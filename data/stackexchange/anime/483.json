In Dragon Ball Z, during Goku's fight with Frieza, Frieza decides to destroy the planet Namek. However he fails to do so, but he claims that the planet will blow up in 5 minutes, at the most, but several episodes later, the two are still seen fighting. \nExactly how much broadcast time (real time) elapsed before the planet actually blew up? \nI am looking for the total broadcast time (NOT the time passed in-universe) it took for planet Namek to explode. \nExcluding: \n\nOP and ED theme time \nCommercials\nEvents happening concurrently with the Frieza battle\n\nBut including: \n\nFillers (the concurrent event rule applies here as well)\n\nStarting from: \n\nWhen Frieza says that it will take five minutes \n\nEnding when: \n\nThe planet actually blows up\n\n"}

I checked the synopsis here and I was wondering about the genre of parody.\n\nI\u2019ve completed the season of One Punch Man and there was no parody of anything in the anim\u00e9. The only parody anim\u00e9 I\u2019ve experienced before is Gintama and the parody is altogether at another level! Whereas, One Punch Man had relatively none. Am I missing something or is it an error?\n"}
