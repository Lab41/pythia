{"body_text": "What exactly does \"best girl\" mean and where did the expression originate from? I've seen the expression \"best girl\" being used several times, and I find it quite self-explanatory.

Here are some different definitions from one or two reddit threads:  \nI was wondering if there's some sort of \"official\" definition for the expression \"best girl\".\nBeside that, where did the expression (or meme, I'm not sure it is considered a meme) originate from?\nIs this an expression that is used in Japan too, or is it a Western thing?\n", "post_id": "19716", "cluster_id": 1014, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "On the origins of the term \"forced drama\" as it is used in discourse about anime User /u/JekoJeko5 has recently posted on /r/anime his observation that the term \"forced drama\" is almost exclusively used in discussions of anime. It is difficult to give a concrete description of what \"forced drama\" is, but many users in the linked thread have offered their opinions on the matter. The one that seems most \"correct\" (or at least, most pithy) to me is this one by /u/OverKillv7:\nIn retrospect (now that the topic has been brought up), I do notice that the term really isn't used in non-anime circles. I find it interesting that the English-speaking anime community has developed this term, presumably to describe a particular kind of frustrating storytelling that is common in anime. \nWhat I would like to know is this: how did the term originate and gain cachet in discussions of anime? (Basically, I'm looking for something analogous to my earlier answers about \"waifu\" and \"best girl\".)\nAs with many internet neologisms, I suspect this one originated on 4chan, though I'm not sure whether we can pin this on /a/ specifically. Snowclones of the term are reasonably popular on 4chan; for example, \"forced fun\" on /v/ and \"forced animation\" on /a/ (both of these examples are mostly used parodically). The /a/ archiver returns results going all the way back to February 2008, when archival began, which gives us an upper bound on how late the term could have been coined. I'm not sure how to proceed for getting to the root of \"forced drama\", though - and that's where you come in, dear answerers. \n", "post_id": "24038", "cluster_id": 1014, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
