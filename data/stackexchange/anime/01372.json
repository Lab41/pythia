{"body_text": "When does The Last: Naruto the Movie take place within Naruto Shippuden anime series and Naruto manga? I've recently binge watched all of the original Naruto series and have started on Naruto Shippuden (around episode 20 as of now). Recently, I heard that the movie The Last: Naruto the Movie came out. From what I have heard, the movie has spoilers about the end of the manga (like chapter 700), but I'm currently not reading the manga (though I plan on starting).\nIf I were to watch the movie, when does the movie take place within Naruto Shippuden, if at all? I saw somewhere saying that it took place at around episode 399-400, but I also heard that a series following Shippuden is coming, so I don't know if I should watch Shippuden, then the upcoming series, and then the movie. \n", "post_id": "20657", "cluster_id": 1372, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
