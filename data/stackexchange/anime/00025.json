{"body_text": "What happens to the discarded body of a person hit by the Dying Will bullet? In the Reborn manga, being hit with a Dying Will bullet kills you, and you are \"reborn\" from inside your own body, leaving a carcass behind.  You can see multiple times in the manga that it's not just the clothes that are left behind, but the person's \"shed skin\" as well.\nAs far as I remember, nobody ever acknowledged this through the entire run of the series.\nAre the bodies left when a person is hit by the Dying Will bullet ever explained?\n", "post_id": "2365", "cluster_id": 25, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Why does Tsuna lose his clothes when infused with the Dying Will? In Katekyo Hitman Reborn, whenever Tsuna enters \"Dying Will Mode\", his clothes tear in half (though he seems to have no shortage of replacements), with the exception of his underpants. This is briefly mentioned on the Reborn Wiki:\nHowever, I'm not far into the series and really have no idea why this happens (it bugs me every episode). His muscles don't really expand or anything, the clothes just seem to rip and fly off.\nCan anyone shed some light on this, or is this a case of \"Rule of Funny\" as a running gag?\n", "post_id": "2270", "cluster_id": 25, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
