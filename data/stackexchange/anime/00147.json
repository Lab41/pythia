As we know, the homunculi can heal themselves and don't age because of the philosopher's stone. \nHowever, Wrath doesn't seem able to heal and he gets older, despite being a homunculus.

{"body_text": "What's the difference between Father, Van Hohenheim, and the main Homunculi? After rewatching most of FMA: Brotherhood, I'm a bit confused.\nIn Episode 40, Van Hohenheim explained that he's a humanoid form of the Philosopher's Stone. What difference does it make from the main Homunculi (Pride, Wrath, Envy, Gluttony, Lust, and the others) who use it only as an energy source?\nFor example, Wrath was a regular human being before he got the Stone, compared to Hohenheim who is the Stone itself. What are they different in?\nAlso, is Father the same? Since he was a Homunculus too (or whatever, I'm not even sure...), but he got the same \"reward\" in Xerxes as Hohenheim.\nSo, what's the difference between Father, Van Hohenheim, and the Homunculi? \n", "post_id": "5628", "cluster_id": 147, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
