{"body_text": "Do otaku tend to be bullied? Otaku in Japan are somehow equivalent to being geek, meaning they are tend to be bullied or looked down upon. That's why some don't admit that they are otaku because of shame. And there are certain cases of otaku becoming a hikikomori, (an example of this is in Welcome to the NHK where the male protagonist is a hikikomori) wherein they isolate themselves or withdraw themselves from society and a NEET (Not in Education, Employment or Training), where they remain jobless. How true are these cases and is it true that most of hikikomori and NEET are otakus (like Misaki Nakahara in Welcome to the NHK)? Or hikikomori and NEET people tend to become otaku (just like Tatsuhiro Sato in Welcome to the NHK)?\n", "post_id": "2953", "cluster_id": 59, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Is the term Otaku derogatory? I know the term is widely used in America as a term for someone who has a love and anime and all things related to it. So in the US it's a term of endearment. \nHowever in Japan the term is known more or less to be used to describe a shut-in / loner. But it actually originated from a few variations. One being the name of a stalker / murderer another just meaning someone with a love for Japanese culture. \nSo is the term really bad, good or more or less up to the individual to find a meaning?   \n", "post_id": "3410", "cluster_id": 59, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
