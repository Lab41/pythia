{"body_text": "What was the first anime aired in HD? I saw this post about What was the first anime to come out on Bluray/HDDVD on this site, and I wonder what was the first anime that aired in HD?\nI first thought of it is aired in around 2008. For example: \nThe recent answer shows these 2 anime (Ghost in the Shell: SAC and Samurai 7) were the possible first anime to air in widescreen.\nFun fact: Samurai 7 is aired just 4 months earlier than One Piece. Does this makes One Piece the 2nd runner-up? LOL.\n", "post_id": "30604", "cluster_id": 1702, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
