In doujins coupling characters from a show off, the characters are usually referred to in the title as \"Character A x Character B\"\n(I feel this snippet from hanagai! explains it better)\n\nIs there any meaning to the order of the 'multiplying'? \nIs the first character mentioned the main character, more dominant, alphabetically first, randomly chosen or something else?\n", "post_id": "13314", "cluster_id": 1052, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "What's with the \"x\" in \"Hunter x Hunter\" (and other anime/manga)? I am wondering what the \"x\" in \"Hunter x Hunter\" means. To clarify: I am also talking about what the \"x\" means in general as many other anime/manga also have it in their titles.\nA quick Google search for this question returns a Yahoo answer result which claims that the \"x\" is just for style and has no meaning whatsoever. Is this correct? Does this also apply to other anime?\n", "post_id": "24142", "cluster_id": 1052, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
