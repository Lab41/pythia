I realize this question has been asked before, but it was 9 months ago and more information has come out since. Here's the information I've compiled so far.\n\nI've been searching on DGM Hiatus Thread (Manga Helpers) \nI've also looked at the Jump SQ Site, but my Japanese is rather poor and I find it hard to navigate. \nI've also been looking on Katsura Hosino's Instagram, not sure if it is verified that it's her's on not. \nFinally I've also seen things on /r/manga that say that it's coming back.\n\nThe problem I have is that I can't find anything definite. I also wouldn't care if it started back up in either Japanese or English, I would learn Japanese if it meant I was able to start reading D.Gray again! Just wondered if you guys knew about anything more about it. Anything would be appreciated! Thanks!\n"}
