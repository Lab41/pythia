{"body_text": "When/Why did Nagi move out of her mansion and into the apartments in the anime? In the first episode of the 4th season (Hayate no Gotoku! Cuties), Nagi is shown living in the apartment building with all of her friends.\n\n(You can't really tell this is the apartments from the screenshot, but note the rather plain looking Japanese-style room compared to her Western-style room in her mansion which definitely had a fancy bed rather than a futon)\nWhen did she move out of her mansion and into the apartments in the anime? I don't remember this happening.\nAnd is there a reason she moved?\nUpdate: In the following episodes, she is shown back in her mansion sometimes as well. This would imply that the current anime season is not fully following the manga which is why I have not accepted the answers giving manga-based answers.\n\n", "post_id": "3625", "cluster_id": 72, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
