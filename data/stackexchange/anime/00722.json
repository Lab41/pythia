{"body_text": "Does the usage of Haki affect the user in any way? We know that Haki is a mysterious power present inside every individual. But only few people are able to awaken and use it. It is very closely related to the willpower of a human being. So the question which arises here is: Does the use of Haki affect the user (physically or mentally) in any way? Does excessive use of Haki take a toll on the user?\n\nIf it is so, how exactly does it affect the user, since Haki isn't something like a physical energy?\nIf it isn't so, why don't the Haki users use it all the time? Why do they use it only in specific cases like a battle, or entering enemy territories, etc?\n\n", "post_id": "8594", "cluster_id": 722, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
