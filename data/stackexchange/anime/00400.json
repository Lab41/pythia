{"body_text": "Why do some Sharingan eyes have unique Mangekyou abilities? Itachi, Sasuke, Madara's Sharingan and Danzo's \"Sharingan\" eyes have the \"standard\" Mangekyou abilities of Amaterasu, Tsukuyomi, Susanoo, Izanagi and Izanami. (Granted not all of them have used all the abilities.)  \nHowever, Shisui and Obito's sharingan have unique Mangekyou abilities (Komoamatsukami and Kamui respectively). Why do some Sharingan eyes come with unique abilities? Do they get these abilities in lieu of the standard abilities or in addition to them?  \nObito has always used Kamui and never been shown using the standard abilities, with his Sharingan (he once used Izanagi with a transplanted Sharingan), which makes me wonder if the special abilities are in lieu of the standard ones. \n", "post_id": "846", "cluster_id": 400, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "How could Kakashi use Susanoo? There are two reasons I have this query (spoiler alert!):\n\n Firstly, Obito didn't have Susanoo. Considering you need to awaken both Tsukuyomi and Amaterasu, while Obito never used even one of them, how was Kakashi able to use Obito's eyes to produce Susanoo? If he copied Susanoo, then how did he do that? Is it even possible to copy something like Susanoo?\n\n Secondly, not being of the Uchiha bloodline, he faces immense problems in using even a single eye for long periods of time. He almost lost half his chakra by making a lightning clone against Deva Path. On top of that, now he has both eyes after a long drawn battle fighting the likes of Zetsu, Obito, Madara and now Kaguya, how is he even supposed to stand?\n\n", "post_id": "13326", "cluster_id": 400, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
