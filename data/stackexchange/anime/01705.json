{"body_text": "When did the transition from standard definition (4:3) to widescreen (16:9) for television anime happen? Modern television anime is produced at an aspect ratio of 16:9 - widescreen/HD. But in the past, television anime was more often produced at an aspect ratio of 4:3 - standard definition.\nWhen did the transition from 4:3 to 16:9 for television anime happen?\nNow, it's not too difficult to find isolated examples to get a sense for when the switchover was in progress. For example, Ouran High School Host Club, from spring 2006, was produced at 4:3, while Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid, from summer 2005, was produced at 16:9. Clearly, the transition was under way by 2005, but not complete by 2006. And I'm fairly confident that by 2011, all television anime were in 16:9 (Ninja Slayer notwithstanding). \nBut what I'm looking for is a more holistic view of how this transition happened. Who were the major players? Can we identify a clear starting date for the transition? And so forth. \n", "post_id": "25975", "cluster_id": 1705, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "What was the first anime aired in HD? I saw this post about What was the first anime to come out on Bluray/HDDVD on this site, and I wonder what was the first anime that aired in HD?\nI first thought of it is aired in around 2008. For example: \nThe recent answer shows these 2 anime (Ghost in the Shell: SAC and Samurai 7) were the possible first anime to air in widescreen.\nFun fact: Samurai 7 is aired just 4 months earlier than One Piece. Does this makes One Piece the 2nd runner-up? LOL.\n", "post_id": "30604", "cluster_id": 1705, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
