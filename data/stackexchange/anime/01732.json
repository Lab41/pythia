{"body_text": "Is Cheese-kun real? In Code Geass, particularly in the original Japanese version, we can see there was something like a product placement exchanged (as shown in this answer) between the series and Pizza Hut.\n\n\nLater in the series, C.C. starts having stickers and a giant plush of what appears to be Pizza Hut's mascot, named Cheese-kun.\n\n\nNow, back when Code Geass first appeared in the west, I did not notice Pizza Hut having anything like Cheese-kun in Australia, but then again it appears there was an attempt to remove Pizza Hut references from the series when it was localized in the west.\nSo I am wondering, does Cheese-kun exist in Japan? If so, did it exist before or after Code Geass? Who created it, the author of Code Geass or Pizza Hut? And does it still represent Pizza Hut now?\n", "post_id": "31293", "cluster_id": 1732, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
