How can a soul gem be tainted by anything but grief/despair? How was Madoka not able to take Homura into the Law of Cycles since that's what her wish was in the first place? Homura was somehow able to void Madoka's wish and do whatever she wanted. None of this makes any sense.\n", "post_id": "26371", "cluster_id": 1204, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
