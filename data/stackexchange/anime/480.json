I made this question before but since a single answer won't suffice, I have broke it down into different post as suggested by other users. TL;DR: I'm tring to understand the story, not the analogies.\nSo, What is the power to bring revolution? Is it actual power (like the type you see in shounen animes) or is it just an analogy about making the world accept behaviors like homosexuality and incest (as seen in events related with Akio & Touga or Akio & Anthy)?\n"}
