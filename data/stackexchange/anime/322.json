In the English dub, during the fight between the Third Hokage Sarutobi and Orochimaru in the first Naruto series, Sarutobi says that after using the Reaper Death Seal, the souls trapped in the Reaper are tormented for all eternity. \nDoes this mean that the souls of the First through Fourth Hokages were suffering from the time they were sealed away until they were released in Naruto Shippuden? Or was this a mistranslation? \nWhen the First through Fourth Hokages were brought back by Orochimaru in Shippuden, they didn't seem like they were being tormented - or rather - it appeared that they had no recollection of their time outside of reality. \nSo which one is it? I did not watch the sub/Japanese episodes or read the manga from this part of the series.\n"}

During the battle against the Kyuubi, Minato split the Kyuubi's chakra into two halves, sealed the Yin-half into himself and the Yang-half into the newborn Naruto. He then dies shortly afterwards due to use of the Shiki Fujin technique, and was sealed into the Shinigami's stomach along with the Yin-Kyuubi.\n17 years later, he was released from the Shinigami's stomach, and he was seen using the Kyuubi Chakra mode right away. It took Naruto nearly 17 years to achieve the same Kyuubi Chakra mode after going through a lot of trouble, so how was Minato able to use it almost instantly?  \n"}
