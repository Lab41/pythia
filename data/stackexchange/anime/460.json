So, I've been enjoying SAO quite a bit more than I thought I would. My only thing is, why has no one in ALO even questioned if Kirito is the same Kirito from SAO? Especially his sister? I'm going on the assumption that their would have been some sort of news when he got out of the game, and that his character name would be mentioned. I know that if I see a character with the same name in multiple MMO's, I at least ask if they are the same person. I have to believe that SOMEONE would recognize the name at least.\nAlso, thinking back on it, I remember them reading something, seemingly the internet, inside SAO, that listed the news of what was going on in the game. So surely this was available to the outside world as well?\n"}

If so, why didn't Sugu recognize him and if not, why is that?\n"}
