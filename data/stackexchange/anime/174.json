In FMA, alchemists draw transmutation circles that are made up of perfect circles and regular polygons. \n\nIs it ever show how they make perfect circles and entirely equal angles? I know that it is difficult to free-hand draw things like that. Is anybody ever shown using rulers/compasses, or is it just understood that they are all able to free-hand circles/polygons without them?\n"}
