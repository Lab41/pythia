The primary purpose of sites here should be indexing information about series. While it's acceptable to link to sites that do have some information related to e.g. fansubs, the primary purpose of all links in answers here should be indexing, not providing download links. Also, databases which are out-of-date should be removed.\nNon-English sources are welcome so long as they qualify, but please specify what language in parentheses.\n", "post_id": "4696", "cluster_id": 603, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "What was the first anime that uses different ending/opening songs in every episode? After watching a few series I realised that some of them use different opening/ending songs in each episode (e.g. Oreimo). I noticed that it must've been quite expensive to do this, and some other animes like Love Live use the same song sang by different people every episode.\nWhat was the first anime that has done this, and can you list the animes that has done this?\nClarification: If the anime has 12 episodes, there has to be 12 different endings, not less than that.\n", "post_id": "8194", "cluster_id": 603, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
