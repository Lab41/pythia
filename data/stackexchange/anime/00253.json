{"body_text": "Where does the term \"waifu\" come from? I was stalking a forum looking for images to nab to use as wallpapers, and there was a post where posters were claiming characters as their \"waifu\".\nSeeing how it is spelled, I would assume that what they mean is \"wife\"; however, it seems weird to use the term \"waifu\" rather than the normal Japanese term for wife (my understanding is that it's \"Tsuma\" (\u59bb); however, I could be wrong).\nSo, where did the term \"waifu\" come from? If I am wrong, and \"waifu\" isn't what I think it is, could someone explain what it is and where it came from?\n", "post_id": "4754", "cluster_id": 253, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
