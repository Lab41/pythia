At his current state, how could Madara possibly be defeated?\nAny physical attack/Taijutsu would be easily deflected by either:  \n\nThe Susano'o  \nThe Gunbai (war fan, which proved to easily negate a Bijuudama)  \nShinra Tensei (which wasn't seen yet, but we have to assume he's capable of it).\n\n\n And I'm not even starting to talk about the Rikudo mode.\n\nAny non-physical attack would be easily absorbed by the Preta Rinnegan path. There aren't many ultra-powerful genjutsu ninja who can hope to trap him in a genjutsu for more than 2 seconds. And in the offshoot that something does hurt him, he'd just regenerate. He's a zombie.\n\nWhat weakness does Madara have that could be exploited to harm him? They'd have to damage him badly to hope for a seal.\n"}

After going through this link,I came to a beleif that Sound Genjutsu is far more superior to Eye genjutsu.\nAfter recalling the incident of the two Sage Toads' genjutsu and Kabuto's genjutsu,I felt that it was difficult for the Sharingan/Rinnegan users to concentrate on their battle.\nSo is my speculation true?\nSome of the sound genjutsu techniques are listed here:- \n\nDemonic Illusion: Toad Confrontation Chant\nTemple of Nirvana Technique\nDemonic Flute:Phantom Sound Chains\n\n"}
