{"body_text": "How much content is required at minimum for a manga to get anime adaptation? How many chapters or volumes of manga is required at minimum for a manga to get anime adaptation once the decision is made?\nI mean some animes start airing while their manga is still being released and sometimes the amount of material only suffices for a 12-13 episode season only.\nOthers wait and get adapted to make a 26-52 episode season of an anime. Who takes that decision to say \"OK! Let's make that an anime NOW!\"\nUpdate\nTo make it somewhat clearer, I'm asking about the length of the manga it takes to be adapted to an anime. Even if a decision was made to convert a manga to an anime there is still that point in time that they say \"ok. we now have enough material for a season\"\nThe duplicate question asks in general what it takes for a manga to adapted in anime.\n", "post_id": "13552", "cluster_id": 419, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
