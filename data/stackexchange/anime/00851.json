{"body_text": "Origins of the nose-bleed in anime/manga In a similar spirit to my previous question, I wonder who was the first artist to feature a nose-bleed when thinking, shall we say, \"provocative thoughts\"?  Did it become popularized in anime/manga because of the popularity of the artist's work or because it is a common belief in japanese folklore?\n", "post_id": "5193", "cluster_id": 851, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Does the \"bloody nose\" trope necessarily imply a sexual situation? If you've seen much anime, you're familiar with the male character getting a bloody nose when he gets sexually excited. For example:\n\n\nMaster Roshi (Dragon Ball) and Umino Iruka (Naruto)\nHowever, when I mentioned this to a Japanese person (someone who was not a big anime viewer), she was confused, and adamant that a bloody nose would normally just mean that the person was excited in general, and it would not necessarily have anything to do with sexual excitement.\nThis could (and seems likely to be) true for Japanese day to day real life, but very different in anime, where the connection to libido seems very clear.  \nIs there someone that can explain this difference? Is the \"bloody nose\" in anime just used to signify excitement, and it just happens to often (always) be sexual excitement because of the plot? Or is it supposed to be just understood how a bloody nose is interpreted in anime is different from normal life?\n", "post_id": "39", "cluster_id": 851, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
