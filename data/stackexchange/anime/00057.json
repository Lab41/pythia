{"body_text": "Was Lelouch the person driving the cart in the last scene of Code Geass R2? At the ending of Code Geass R2, the last scene showed someone whose face wasn't showed riding a horse-pulling-cart with CC. I believe that it is indeed Lelouch (who was previously stabbed by Suzaku wearing Zero's uniform as part of their Code Zero plan to free Elevens), and that he had gained immortality because of his frequent usage of his Geass. \nLelouch's Geass first leveled-up the episode when he accidentally ordered his sister Euphemia to kill all Elevens. Then, his father King Charles was beaten by him and I'm thinking that King Charles' immortality was transferred to him. \nIf that person was really Lelouch, then, has he already gained immortality by that time? \n", "post_id": "116", "cluster_id": 57, "novelty": true, "order": 0}

In the short one-shot Death Billiards, the old man says something to the bartender at the end when they choose which elevator to get into (presumably, one goes to hell and the other to heaven). What did the old man say? He smirked at the end so it seemed like he got something that he wanted or had somehow tricked the younger man. The bartender wouldn't say what it was. Am I missing something or is this just completely wide-open-ended?\n", "post_id": "3334", "cluster_id": 57, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
