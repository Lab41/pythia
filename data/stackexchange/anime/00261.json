{"body_text": "Why does season 2 of Gurren Lagann start so differently compared to season 1? Episode 1 of  the second part of season 1 of Gurren Lagann features more political themes than those seen in season one. However from episode two onwards it returns to being more about action.\nIs this to do with how they were aired? Was this change enforced, so as to move away from the Mecha stereotype, by a 'higher up' in Gainax...and simply ignored from episode 18 onwards? In western TV, ratings that are seen by executives can influence the show...has something similar happened here?\nWhy is this?\n", "post_id": "7971", "cluster_id": 261, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
