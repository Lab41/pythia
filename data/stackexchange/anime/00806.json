{"body_text": "How many Dragons are there in total in Fairy Tail? Some of the Dragon Slayers were trained by Dragons, while others gained Dragon Slayer Magic by means of Lacrima implants (as in the case of Laxus). For Lacrima implants, the Dragon Slayer Magic has to be extracted from a Dragon (that's my assumption). So how many Dragons in total, living or dead, exist in Fairy Tail? If possible please provide their names. \n", "post_id": "22231", "cluster_id": 806, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
