{"body_text": "What does Tanaka do? What exactly is Tanaka's function in the Phantomhive family? To my understanding from watching the anime season 1 and 2 the manga(up to the phantomhive murders arc) and the ovas. It seems like he was Vincent's head butler back when he was the head of the house.\nBut since Ciel has come into power along with Sebastian his functions seems small. In the anime and manga when Sebastian assigns tasks he always tells Tanaka \"The usual will be fine\". What does this mean? Can anyone explain? \n", "post_id": "27382", "cluster_id": 1304, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
