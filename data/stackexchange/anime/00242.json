{"body_text": "Which god of Japan is actually portrayed by Yato in Noragami? As far as I watched, Bishamon and Kofuku are portrayals of the Seven Lucky Gods (\u4e03\u798f\u795e shichi fukujin). But it wasn't clear about Yato. Bishamon mentioned him as a God of Calamity, but there is no such god among the Seven Lucky Gods. So, which god might Yato be a portrayal of? Is he a new character altogether?\n", "post_id": "7550", "cluster_id": 242, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
