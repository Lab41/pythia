In Mahouka Koukou it seems apparent that magic seems to take the form of Guns or Snipers for some reason.\nDoes magic actually have a form or is this yet to come further on in the series since so far the latest episode which was number 3 only came out a couple days ago.\nAlso how was it that they turned/synthesised magic into an actual form of technology?\n", "post_id": "8830", "cluster_id": 972, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "What actually is modern magic, and how does it work? The opening to the anime starts out with a monologue from Tatsuya explaining that magic, once a product of fantasy and the imagination, has actually been synthesised into a modern technology during the 21st century.\nHowever, during the show's entirety, there is no concise explanation of magic, or any of its core concepts. Certain spells have a rough description before they're activated, but the fundamentals are never covered, or not at a depth where a desirable understanding of the phenomenon of magic is attainable. Additionally, the spin off series Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei \u2013 Yoku Wakaru Mahouka! only has one episode that covers how magic works, and the information there is pretty sparse.\nSo how does modern magic work? What does a CAD really do? What are Psions, CADs and an Eidos, and how do they influence each other to give the result we see in the series?\n", "post_id": "23635", "cluster_id": 972, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
