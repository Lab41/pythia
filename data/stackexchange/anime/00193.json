I know that White Album 2 recently started, but it doesn't seem like it has anything to do with the first White Album aside from being a similar genre of music related romance stories.\nThe original White Album was about the triangle of Yuki, Rina and Touya and the second White Album seems to be about 3 different people, Setsuna, Haruki and Kazusa.\n", "post_id": "5484", "cluster_id": 193, "novelty": true, "order": 0}

I want to start watching the White Album 2 anime but I want to play the VN also. \nI heard that the story from the anime is different than the game. Is this true? Because I would rather play the game first if it's the same story, but if it's an new anime original story I will watch it first. \n", "post_id": "6329", "cluster_id": 193, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
