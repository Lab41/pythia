{"body_text": "What is the in-universe chronological order of the Monogatari Series? I have Bakemonogatari and Nisemonogatari, and learned that Monogatari Series Second Season is being streamed by Aniplex, which means that Nekomonogatari would have been streamed at some point and that it would get a home release.\nSo, I am wondering what the story's in-universe chronological order is: should I watch Bakemonogatari, Kizumonogatari (when it's released), Nekomonogatari (when it's released), Monogatari Series Second Season (when it's released) and Nisemonogatari?\n", "post_id": "4695", "cluster_id": 108, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "What is the production order of the Monogatari series? It's rather confusing how the story is serialized not in the order of its events. I'd like to know the order in which the animated versions were produced.\n\nTurns out the creators of the series are very considerate towards the viewers and include several recap episodes in each season. So although the story is out of order, everything still makes perfect sense and you don't have to bother yourself by figuring out the exact timeline of the original.\n", "post_id": "4727", "cluster_id": 108, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
