It starts playing when Luffy rushes Doflamingo saying that once the latter's defeated, everything will be okay.\nP.S. If the name of that song specifically is within another song (an example being the piece \"Difficult\" being composed of both the songs \"Shichibukai\" and \"Mr. Prince\"), please specify the song part specifically.\n", "post_id": "27987", "cluster_id": 1410, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "What is the name of the song that plays in One Piece episode 722 at 12:28? The question is similar to this one but the song I'm looking for is different. I'm looking for the song that started approximately at 12:28 in episode 722. It begins when Doflamingo begins speaking. The voices cover some parts, but I like the song a lot.\n", "post_id": "28004", "cluster_id": 1410, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
