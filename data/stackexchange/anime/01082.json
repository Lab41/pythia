{"body_text": "Is it common for seiy\u016b's to also be singers? While listening to the Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha Openings i noticed that the first 4 Opening songs (Original Series - StrikerS) were all sung by Nana Mizuki, the seiy\u016b of Fate Testarossa. Looking at her Wikipedia Page i've also noticed that she's also been the seiy\u016b for Hinata Hyuga in the Naruto Movies\nNow the other groups i know of who did Openings/Endings are FLOW, ALI PROJECT, ORANGE RANGE, Kalafina and ClariS but i do not know if any singer of these groups were also a seiy\u016b for any series (particularly ones their music was in) but i am wondering if it is common for a seiy\u016b to also be a singer? \nif so is it also expected that if a singer sung the Opening/Ending Theme (or Insert Songs) they will also score a character role in the series?\n", "post_id": "24410", "cluster_id": 1082, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
