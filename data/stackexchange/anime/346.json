Why does the Final Fantasy franchise of RPGs, anime, manga, etc. contain \"Final\" in the title?\n\nIs it that the original concept of the first game was intended to portray the ending of a story? Was it derived from in-universe content?\nOr is it because the creators did not plan to produce more games, and did not expect that any sequels would be desired?\nOr was the inclusion of the word \"final\" chosen for a completely reason?\n\n"}

In both One Piece and in Overlord, there is a character named Momonga (in Overlord, Momonga was his earlier name, but he goes by Ainz Ooal Gown during the series).\n \n\u300c\u30e2\u30e2\u30f3\u30ac\u300d (momonga) is the Japanese word for \"flying squirrel\" and is used for the type native to Japan, as well as for the northern flying squirrel and southern flying squirrel of North America, and for the Siberian dwarf flying squirrel (in contrast, the word \u300c\u30e0\u30b5\u30b5\u30d3\u300d [musasabi] is used to refer to giant flying squirrels native to and outside of Japan), and the marsupial sugar glider is called \u300c\u30d5\u30af\u30ed\u30e2\u30e2\u30f3\u30ac\u300d (fukuro momonga).\nThese characters both are not particularly cute, are large in size, have small eye sockets, and do not feature a patagium (a.k.a. gliding membrane-like flap of skin or fabric stretched from their wrists to their ankles). In other words, they do not feature the best-known features of flying squirrels. Why were they named Momonga?  Is there anything about them that was intentionally derived from real-life flying squirrels?\n\n"}
