My question is: Where do the specials fit into the series? Between the two seasons? Side stories? Prequel? After season 2? When should I watch them?\nThe episode lists I've found seem to leave out the specials so I'm not sure how they fit in.\n", "post_id": "18840", "cluster_id": 597, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
