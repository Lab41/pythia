If \"Haoshoku Haki\" then is it different from other users? \nThis question came to my mind after rewatching all episodes of One Piece. \nShank's Haki seemed to be different from that of others. When Shanks was going to meet White Beard before the Ace's death, he cracked the wood even though he wasn't using Haki. \nLike Luffy, he too needs to use his Haki to effect someone but Shanks didn't use it and  yet everybody on board the ship was affected.\n"}

It is not different from the things that humans can naturally sense such as these... 'The act of not doubting'.
