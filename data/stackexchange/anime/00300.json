{"body_text": "Nagato's Eye in Edo tensei Mode After seeing this discussion here, I think how come Edo-tensei nagato had rinnegan. Nagato's original eyes were normal. He received rinnegan from madara. So his edo tensei form should have had normal eyes not rinnegan, if edo tensei brings the original soul; because his eyes were normal until madara gave him his rinnegan.\n", "post_id": "7147", "cluster_id": 300, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Why does Edo Tensei Nagato possesses Rinnegan? I was thinking about something strange. How come Nagato has the rinnengan again when he is revived by Kabuto. I mean in the end those eyes weren't his, they were Madara's so it dosen't seem logical for him to have them when he was brought back. What do you think?\n", "post_id": "8808", "cluster_id": 300, "novelty": false, "order": 1}
