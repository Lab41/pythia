Although I have not watched the Fate/Zero TV series, I have watched the Fate/stay night series and the Fate/Stay Night - Unlimited Blade Works movie.

So I did not know if he is actually Shir\u014d from the future or if he is a completely different character than the one in the TV series.\n\n", "post_id": "444", "cluster_id": 26, "novelty": true, "order": 0}

But in the Manga, it only shows how he became a heroic spirit.\nThe Holy Grail takes the soul or spirit from people of legends and myths.  So who was Archer in Fate Stay Night?\n\nOnly answer from Fate Stay Night, anime or manga.
