{"body_text": "What software is used for making anime? Is there any particular software or software family specifically designed for making anime?\nAre they drawing all the frames of motion scenes, or does a software automatically generate them? For example, consider a soccer player kicking a football. Let the duration of the scene be 0.5 seconds, and let the frame rate of the video be 24 fps; that makes 12 frames in that scene. Do they patiently draw all those 12 frames manually for that scene which takes only half a second?\n", "post_id": "4", "cluster_id": 16, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Is \"Anime Studio\" animation software used professionally in making anime? Is Anime Studio used by any popular Anime studios for actual, commercial Anime production?\nI know it's fairly common with amateurs and quite a few Western Animation professionals, but has it ever been used to produce a full season of an anime series that was aired in Japanese TV, or some Anime of comparable scale? Or is just a marketing twist, and only ever Western animation of professional quality has been made in it?\n", "post_id": "2018", "cluster_id": 16, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
