The few we know that gets a little bit explained are, for example, Minato (4th Hokage) and Obito (Tobi).\nDespite of this, a lot of characters (mainly in the anime) \"disappear\" with a flashy exit when they wish. Orochimaru does this a couple of times, including others. Often with a phrase such as \"I don't have time to play around with you any more\" and then poof, gone!\nIs there some explanation to this?
