Homura appears to shoot herself in the head after being unable to persuade Mami about what's going on. After the event, it seems that we see the exiting bullet, and we also see blood around the left side of Homura's face.\nIf this is the case, why is Homura still alive afterwards? Or did she not actually manage to shoot herself, or did she (or Mami) perhaps manage to heal herself afterwards?\n"}

In the Rebellion movie, when Homura was fighting Mami, she can't break Mami's ribbon, but in the end, she was able to do that. How can this happen? And if Mami's ribbon already attached in Homura's feet (just like picture on the left), why didn't Mami just pulled her ribbon so Homura won't move? \n \n"}
