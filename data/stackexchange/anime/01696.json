{"body_text": "What is the production order of the Monogatari series? It's rather confusing how the story is serialized not in the order of its events. I'd like to know the order in which the animated versions were produced.\n\nTurns out the creators of the series are very considerate towards the viewers and include several recap episodes in each season. So although the story is out of order, everything still makes perfect sense and you don't have to bother yourself by figuring out the exact timeline of the original.\n", "post_id": "4727", "cluster_id": 1696, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
