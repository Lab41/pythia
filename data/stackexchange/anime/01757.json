{"body_text": "Where do the American and Japanese Transformers franchises meet? The original Transformers TV series was created by the American company Hasbro, and was adapted into Japanese as well. At some point, the Japanese franchise split off into its own continuity, launching its own set of sequels and spin offs.\nThe questions is: What part of the American franchise is considered canon by the Japanese one? Minor details such as name changes are not to be taken into consideration.\n", "post_id": "3223", "cluster_id": 1757, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Does a series in Japan only get aired if it has more than 13 episodes? while reading this answer it said in one of the quotes\nhowever i have a number of series which don't have even 20 episodes like Puella Magi Madoka Magica (12 episodes), Black Rock Shooter (Series) (8 Episodes), Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha (the original series and A's, 13 episodes each) and a number of Monogatari series have less than 10 episodes\nSo i am wondering if what the quote says is accurate and if so how does a series, like the ones i mention, get aired on TV if they aren't long enough to warrant airing on Japanese TV?\n", "post_id": "31759", "cluster_id": 1757, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
