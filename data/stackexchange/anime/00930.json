{"body_text": "How accurate is the cooking in Food Wars? I'm familiar with some other cooking shows, but not all of them are nearly as experimental as Food Wars. With something like \"Yakitate!\", being a baker, there's a lot of truth behind the recipes and some of the crazy things Azuma and some of the other bakers did. Not being a chef, I can't tell if some of the cooking/recipes in \"Food Wars\" actually work like they claim in the show. For example, in a recent episode Soma used some crushed something (I can't remember) as the breading for fried fish, or the use of honey to tenderize meat; how accurate are these things from the show?\n", "post_id": "22080", "cluster_id": 930, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
