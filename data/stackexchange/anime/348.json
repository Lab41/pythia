Each bullet has a special attribute. For example, when he shoots with a silver bullet, it produces mist or something like that. The guy is wearing a hat and a coat, and has a long hair. I think he has a scar on his face. From what I remember, the title has something like \"Rave\" or the character is named \"Rave\".\n"}

I was directed to this post \u2014 Anime guy with a gun having different colored, special bullets \u2014 on this site while searching for an anime. Unfortunately, it wasn't what I am looking for, though the description is almost the same. What I am looking for is an anime that I've watched maybe in the year 2002? I really loved it, but I forgot its title. Here are some clues of this guy:\n\nObviously he has a gun with special bullets of different colors that match to what I think are these elements:\n\n\nred bullets = fire\ngreen bullets = wind\nblue bullets = water.\n\nThere is this TRAIN, which serves as the only transportation?\nAs far as I can recall, it seems that there is this UNDERGROUND WORLD where kids are living.\nThere are monsters around and this guy acts as the HERO.\nI think he is wearing a dark CAPE?\nHis bullets aren't infinite, but are probably quite rare or hard to create\n\nPlease help me find this guy!\n"}
