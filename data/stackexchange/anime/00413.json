In the first Hunter Exam of the series (Hisoka's second), he was introduced into the series removing another applicant's arms from his body for bumping into him and not apologizing.\n\nWhat did he actually do?

(The \"404\" is not a translation error; however, the \"All 404\" may be.)\nWas Satotz referring to the \"disarmed\" applicant, did he make a mistake in his headcount, or is there something else in play that I'm missing?\n", "post_id": "13449", "cluster_id": 413, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
