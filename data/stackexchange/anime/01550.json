{"body_text": "Why is Suigintou's title \"Mercury Lamp?\" Looking on the Rozen Maiden Wikia for the Rozen Maidens, I notice they all have titles\n\nSuigintou = Mercury Lamp \nShinku = Pure Ruby\nHinaichigo = Small Berry\nSuiseiseki = Jade Stone\nSouseiseki = Lapislazuli Stone\nBarasuishou = Rose Crystal\nKirakishou = Snow Crystal\nKanaria = Canary Bird\n\ni get most of them are either a trait they have (Hinaichigo is small, Barasuishou attacks with crystals) or their primary color scheme (Kirakishou is white like snow, Kanaria is yellow like the general depiction of a canary).\nBut I don't understand why Suigintou has the title of Mercury Lamp. From my understanding, Suigintou's color scheme is black (2013 anime) or purple (2004 anime) while Mercury as the metal is silver, while I don't think the planet is black or purple. Nor do I get how Lamp fits.\nSo how does Suigintou's title match with her?\n", "post_id": "26829", "cluster_id": 1550, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Is there a significance in the names of the artificial spirits? Each of the Rozen Maiden Dolls has an artificial spirit. Since there is so much in this series that has a deeper meaning of some sort (episode titles and doll names jump to mind) I\u2019m assuming that their names will also have a deeper meaning \u2014 especially since there are names such as Pizzicato (Kanaria\u2019s artificial spirit) that are clearly not Japanese at all.\nThe only one that partially makes sense to me though, is Berrybell, Hina-Ichigo\u2019s artificial spirit which fits into the general word-cloud strawberry. What significance is behind the names of the other dolls\u2019 artificial spirits?\n", "post_id": "29135", "cluster_id": 1550, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
