{"body_text": "How much of the original Sailor Moon anime isn't from the manga? While I went through the first 7-8 episodes of the original Sailor Moon, I noticed a few episodes that didn't really advance the plot much. (An example of this would be the episode where Jadeite poses as a radio announcer and sucks the energy out of women who receive fake declarations of love.) I have also found lists of filler episodes on the internet, such as this one, for the original Sailor Moon.\nI've also noticed that a lot of \"unnecessary\" plot seen in those episodes of the original anime is cut from Sailor Moon Crystal, though to some extent this also just makes sense given that they have a limited number of episodes to work with.\nHow closely does the original anime follow the manga? (I understand that they are probably more or less similar in terms of plot, but is there a significant portion of episodes or \"filler\" that's original material and not from the manga?)\nEdit: I am referring to the original Japanese anime, not the English (or European) dubs - I already know that those involved quite a bit of censoring of things like nudity or same-sex relationships. I should also add that I just got into Sailor Moon, and so am not too familiar with it.\n", "post_id": "13487", "cluster_id": 720, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
