{"body_text": "In episode 20 of Attack on Titan how does the female titan have 3D-gear after regaining human form? I remember someone saying (not sure which episode, though probably the same) that Eren lost his 3D-gear after existing his titan form. I also remember seeing that myself both after exiting titan form every time except the 2nd time (He had no gear on then to begin with). So how was the girl inside the female-titan able to have 3D-gear on as well as a survey-corp coat?\nNote: I have finished watching the anime, but I have not read the manga. Please don't post any spoilers for me. Thank you :)\n", "post_id": "23553", "cluster_id": 960, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
