{"body_text": "How different are the anime and manga versions of Akame Ga Kill? Okay, so I watched all of the Akame Ga Kill anime. My question is should I start reading Akame Ga Kiru (the manga) from the beginning or continue from where they split?  I saw on another post that they split around approximately chapter 48. I understand that the overall plot is similar up until that point, but if there are additional characters or skipped over mini-archs then I want to go back and read it all.  If the anime is completely accurate until chapter 48 then I will just start there.\nAnyone know the answer to this?\n(Please no spoilers from anywhere after the anime splits off)\n", "post_id": "19837", "cluster_id": 645, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
