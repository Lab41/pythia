{"body_text": "Is the nature of chakra hereditary? It's been observed that the nature of the chakra a person possesses is determined by the village they are from.\nFor example, people from Iwagakure (Village Hidden in the Rocks) use earth release techniques, while people from Kirigakure (Village Hidden in the Mist) possess water-type chakra.\nThere seem to be exceptions, though.\nFor example, let's consider Konoha : Naruto possesses wind-type chakra while Kakashi and Sasuke possess lightning. Sasuke also possesses fire.\nIs it hereditary, or is there something else that determines it? Or is it random?\nThe 5th Mizukage possesses 3 types of chakra elements: Earth, Fire and Water. If my supposition is correct, how she could achieve this?\n", "post_id": "2771", "cluster_id": 38, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Why does Hashirama Senju possess such huge and terrifying chakra? In the past three Naruto manga chapters (chapters 621~623), the story goes like this: child days of both Hashirama and Madara, and he (Hashirama) is just like every others in Naruto: a normal human being. But when Orochimaru revived all four Hokage in front of Sasuke, Hashirama raises his chakra level to threaten Tobirama, as it would crack all the walls nearby or maybe the entire basement (chapter 620). How could have Hashirama acquired this kind of power (chakra)?\n", "post_id": "2815", "cluster_id": 38, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
