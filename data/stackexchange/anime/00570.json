Kizumonogatari is a movie based on a story of the same name in Monogatari Series light novel, which is part of First Season before Nisemonogatari.

After the delay, they kept producing other stories in Monogatari Series like Monogatari Series: Second Season, Hanamonogatari and Tsukimonogatari.\nWhy did they put it off for so long? If it was because of production issue, like Hanamonogatari, why did they keep producing another Monogatari Series but not Kizumonogatari?\n", "post_id": "18377", "cluster_id": 570, "novelty": true, "order": 0}

From what I have read, Kizumonogatari is a prequel for Bakemonogatari, and the movie is reported to be scheduled for fall 2013.\nHowever, Monogatari Series: Second Season was just released this summer (2013), and is still ongoing, so I thought this movie might not be released (again) this fall.   \nHave they delayed it again?\n", "post_id": "6189", "cluster_id": 570, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
