{"body_text": "What defines one \"season\" of anime? From what I've been able to follow, the seasons of anime shows have been tied to thirteen week blocks, directly correlating with the actual season in Japan (for instance, this is the Winter 2013 season).\nHowever, there are instances in which shows with more than 13 episodes are considered to have only run for one season.\nWhich is the correct definition - are seasons 23-26 episodes, or are they 11-13 episodes?\n", "post_id": "1971", "cluster_id": 259, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "What is a \"cour\"? I often hear shows talked about as being some number of \"cours\". For example, Evangelion is apparently \"two cours\", while Madoka is \"one cour\". \nBut what on earth does \"cour\" mean? I can't find it in any dictionary!\n", "post_id": "7977", "cluster_id": 259, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
