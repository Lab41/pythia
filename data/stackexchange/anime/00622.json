{"body_text": "What other Beaters were there in Sword Art Online? In Episode 8 - Black and White Sword Dance, after Kirito got Asuna to agree to cook the Ragout Rabbit, Asuna dismissed Kuradeel and got refused:\nI was under the impression that Kirito was the only \"Beater\". However, Kuradeel says one of those Beaters, which implies that there are more as apart from him. Using the plural form, Kuradeel is grouping Kirito with others.\nSo I am wondering, were there any other Beaters in SAO? If there were, do we know who they were?\n", "post_id": "13233", "cluster_id": 622, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Did Kirito lie about being the *best* beta tester? I watched SAO on Crunchyroll, where the subtitles for episode 2 have Kirito saying: \nThe implication of word choice and tone in the dub does sound like the kind of exaggerated bragging that gamers do when they're claiming preposterous things, but the subs don't convey that to me at all.\nIs there any information showing whether he was actually lying?  Was he just a good beta tester (possibly in the lead group), or was he really significantly above everyone else?\n", "post_id": "19281", "cluster_id": 622, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
