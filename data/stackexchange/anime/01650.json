{"body_text": "How can I quickly understand the basics of Naruto and the story without watching all 300+ episodes? I would like to start watching Naruto as I have never attempted or tried to get into watching Naruto. The main problem I have is that I don't want to watch all 300+ episodes in Naruto or read the dozens of Mangas to understand what Naruto is about and the many plots that are involved.\nI know this might be a really silly question for someone who watches anime and this may sound very far fetched but I havent watched Naruto before. I do not want to read through pages and pages of information from Naruto's Wikia and do not want to go watching through episode through episode of about 300+ to understand Naruto.\nAre there any episodes in Naruto that will help me understand the story and key terms/terminology without doing this? In other words I am looking for a short cut.\nThink of this scenario: Death Note created two special episodes for those who have not watched it before so they wouldn't have to go through all the episodes to understand the plot. Did Naruto do this? If so that would be extremely helpful.\nPlease note: I have not watched ever Naruto or Naruto Shippuden and as such have no actual knowledge of anything Naruto.\n", "post_id": "8768", "cluster_id": 1650, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
