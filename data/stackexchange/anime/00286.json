{"body_text": "What do the black and red scenes mean? In Bakemonogatari, it often happens that suddenly, a red screen with \"Red Scene (Aka)\" or a black screen with \"Black Scene (Kuro)\" appears for a short time. (At least these are written in my sub.)\nWhat do they mean? Is there any difference between \"Red Scene\" and \"Black Scene\" and why are they used?\n", "post_id": "5325", "cluster_id": 286, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "What is the purpose of the fast appearing screens? Several fast appearing/disappearing screens are featured, during the episodes of the series. They stay on screen for one second or so, and appear out of the blue. This makes them basically impossible to read/understand, unless the viewer pauses the video.  \n\nSo my question is, are they supposed to be fully understood? If so, is the viewer really supposed to pause the video every time a screen like this appears?\nOr are they supposed to be, maybe, only partially understood, and should we carry on with the episode even if we couldn't read/understand everything?\nOr are they really of no importance, and just used to produce some kind of visual effect? In this case, is the content of the screens of little or no importance?\n", "post_id": "8564", "cluster_id": 286, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
