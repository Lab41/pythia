Is it necessary for, for example, Kabuto (the Edo Tensei user) to know all the hand seals and adequate knowledge on other techniques to control and fully utilize the reanimated person per his wish?\nOr is it just a matter of \"controlling a person somehow and use him\"? What I observe is even when being controlled physically, mentally the reanimated character is reluctant (sometimes except few exceptions). Then, if the mind is not under Edo Tensei user's control, how does controlling work?\n"}

This Edo Tensei looks pretty complicated and annoying, since the revived one is immortal and powerful...As we've seen,every soul was freed,and moved to the afterlife(by this I mean normally freed from the jutsu),so if someone decides to use again this jutsu, could it be possible to bring back again a dead person?(meaning,that until you run out of DNA samplse and vessels, you can bring back anyone an infinite time)\nBeing an exception:I'm not reading the manga,but unfortunately I know that the Hokage's are revived, in case of Hashirama and Tobirama to be the second time, BUT they were sealed in the Shinigami,so their souls aren't brought back from the pure world(again,I have no idea about their second arrival, please, no spoiler,just I've mentioned that they came from somewhere else).\nSo for e.g.: could be Itachi brought back again and again with the Edo Tensei, or after his first revival and after his soul sealed, his soul would be \"blocked\" somewhere in the pure world, forbidding an another resurrection of that soul?\n"}
