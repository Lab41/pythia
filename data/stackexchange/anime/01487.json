I noticed that commonly now in anime that mostly female characters' clothes are being torn especially in fight scenes.\nI googled and found this to be called Clothing Damage\nand here are a list of examples from anime and manga from which I remember in High School DxD where the main protragonist Issei uses a technique called Dress Break to make his female enemies lose the will to fight. also in Dog Days and Freezing.\nEven JRPG games such as Doki Doki majo Shinpan and its sequel Doki Doki majo Shinpan Duo 2 has this.\nWho started this trope?
