{"body_text": "Does Obito master the Summoning Jutsu? I've seen the recent episode of the anime, and I saw,when Obito summoned Kurama. I'm interested in the fact,that does he got some kind of \"contract\" with some animals/things??(that would mean,that you are really able to summon). I've checked out on the Narutopedia,and it appears only the Gedo Mazo by his name,so the summoning of the Nine-tails,it's a normal(just simple) summoning technique?? Because you must have that kind of bond between you and the summoned animal,which is made with your chakra/blood, just like Naruto did with the toads and it would be weird if you would be able to summon a tailed beast just \"because\"\n", "post_id": "7531", "cluster_id": 425, "novelty": true, "order": 0}

Also, Naruto was 16 while Kakashi looked about 30, so if Kakashi and Obito were the same age, and Obito summoned Kurama while Naruto was born, he would be younger than Naruto is now.\n", "post_id": "13666", "cluster_id": 425, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
