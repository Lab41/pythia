{"body_text": "Is The Legend of Korra anime? I saw a comment online that stated The Legend of Korra is not anime. I kinda know the argument in that \"anime\" refers to only Japanese animation, but is that so? The style of this anime, the humour, and everything about it seems extremely anime. I understand that it was written by Americans and animated in Korea.\nIs The Legend of Korra seriously not considered anime because of this? \nAm I going to have to categorize this into an alternate genre type, so that I can add Archer and Futurama? Is there a genre type for these types of animations like with \"shoujo\", \"shounen\", \"seinen\", and \"josei\"? \n", "post_id": "14429", "cluster_id": 780, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "What exactly is a \"Light Novel\"? I am only familiar with this term when I know about the anime.\n\nIs this term only used in Japan? \n\nSometimes I read light novels on the internet but I never see the book myself. How is a light novel different from a regular novel? Except for light novels being... light, are there any other differences?\nAnd usually I see the cover done in a manga-style drawing:\n\nAre light novels used exclusively for anime or manga adaptations? \nAre there any light novels that do not use manga-style drawings? \n\nI tried to search \"Light novel cover\" and the result is as expected:\n\n", "post_id": "13301", "cluster_id": 780, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
