I just want to compare the present Naruto (in the anime not in manga... i.e no sage powers yet..) to Hashirama when he was 17-18 years old...\nAs suggested many times that both of them have a great chakra reserves but Hashirama points it out that naruto has almost the same amount of chakra as him i.e including Kurama's chakra... So when Naruto would be in his prime, for example, 25 years of age will he be able to rival Hashirama (without using Kurama's power)?\n", "post_id": "14680", "cluster_id": 468, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
