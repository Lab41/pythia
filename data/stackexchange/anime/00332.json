{"body_text": "Has an anime ever come out before the manga was published? I got into a debate with a friend about whether or not it's possible for an anime to come out before its manga.\nHe claimed that there were several instances where the anime actually preceded the manga. Is this the case? \nP.S.: I know that there are several anime without a manga. I also know that there are manga created from games. That's not what I'm asking. I'm asking whether or not there is a series where the anime came before the manga.\n", "post_id": "2351", "cluster_id": 332, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Are anime that air before a manga adaptation considered filler anime? In the question Has an anime ever come out before the manga was published? it became quite obvious that there are indeed several animes that air before their manga has been made.\nBut this also made me wonder about the following: Does this imply that all anime that air before a manga of it exist should be considered fillers?\nFillers are non-canonical material, which usually implies it did not happen in the manga. Or as Urban Dictionary stated it\n", "post_id": "9939", "cluster_id": 332, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
