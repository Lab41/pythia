{"body_text": "About the artworks used in the Elfen Lied opening scenes (contains nudity) The anime Elfen Lied is notorious for its one of a kind OP, featuring the mesmerizing theme song Lilium composed by MOKA and performed by Kumiko Noma, as well as sequences of art porn, a homage to Austrian symbolist painter Gustav Klimt. The idea to pose the characters as in Klimt's artworks came, as far as I know, from director Mamoru Kanbe, who continued this idea in the OP of Sora no Woto. (In my humble opinion, the OP of Sora no Woto is rather bland, and seriously, Klimt with Kalafina?)\nThis is a self-answered question and a modest attempt at unraveling the sources of and the symbolism represented in Elfen Lied's OP scenes. Other answers and/or suggestions are welcome.\n", "post_id": "15130", "cluster_id": 1620, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
