{"body_text": "Is there a single member of the Einzbern family who is a human being? From the information I could find, nearly all known members of the Einzbern family are (female) homunculi (Justeaze, Irisviel, Illyasviel and all the maids), the only exception being Jubstacheit, who is supposed to be an A.I. controlling an array of humanoid golem bodies. Is there any information on Einzberns who are actually human beings? Are there any alive at all at the time of the events of Fate/Zero and Fate/Stay Night? If there is not, can the Einzberns actually be considered a \"bloodline\" in the strict sense of the word, or are they more like an army of self-cloning homunculi?\n", "post_id": "29732", "cluster_id": 1647, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
