Both the VN and the anime stress that Michiru is a fake blonde.\nMakina and Yumiko have natural hair colors...\nBut what about Amane and Sachi? I don't think there are too many natural redheads in the native japanese population of the Kyoto region (where Amane's parents are from), but I am almost sure no human is born with pink hair.\nIs this just a case of \"anime hair\", and we are supposed to overlook these two hair colors (MST3k style), or is there something else abou these characters?\nWhat about hair color as a recurring element(as @senshin pointed) in other shows?\n", "post_id": "19315", "cluster_id": 701, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
