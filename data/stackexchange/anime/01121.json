{"body_text": "Why was there an apparent violation of the law of cycles in Rebellion? In the Rebellion film, we see Homura turn into what she realises is a witch (after she discovers some oddities about the version of Mitakihara city she's supposedly living in) because of her despair.\nThis reason for her turning into a witch makes sense to me because it would be \"valid\" under the laws of the universe prior to Madoka's changing of them. However, I'm a bit confused about how Homura managed to become a witch after the law of cycles came into \"effect\", if under this regime, magical girls disappear instead of becoming witches once their energy is used up.\nWhy exactly then was there this \"exception\" to the law of cycles? (I might have missed something since I haven't really followed Puella Magi Madoka Magica very closely.) I suppose the fact that Homura is the only person around who knows of what the former \"regime\" was might be important in this, but I think I probably missed something when I watched the film.\n", "post_id": "14187", "cluster_id": 1121, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "How was Sayaka able to join Madoka in the Law of Cycles after her death? Adding onto this question, right after Madoka recreated the entire universe to accommodate with the Law of Cycles, why was everybody placed back in time right after the event where Sayaka gets killed in battle? Why were they placed specifically there in time? Also, do all magical girls join the Law of Cycles after they die? If they do, then what is the point? Madoka's wish was to erase all witches with her own hands, so anybody else in the Law of Cycles wouldn't have a job to carry out since Madoka would be doing it all herself.\n", "post_id": "25699", "cluster_id": 1121, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
