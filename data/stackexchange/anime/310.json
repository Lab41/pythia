Why do we usually see only one person using a type of magic? Look at Cana's magic for example. Out of everything shown via the Anime, no one else has used it on their own. Same with Reedus, Makarov, Evergreen, Bickslow, Gildarts, Jura, Erza (Knight), and many other people.\nI can understand why limited number of people use the rare/lost magic (Dragon Slayer and other lost types), but what about the more modern magics?\n"}

I've noticed that in Fairy Tail everyone has a different type of magic. But would it be possible to possess more than one type of magic? For example: Natsu being able to use Fire Dragon Slayer Magic and and also being able to use Magic like Gray's Ice-Make spells? Or are there rules for his Dragon Slayer Magic not allowing him to use different kinds of Magic? \n"}
