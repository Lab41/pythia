{"body_text": "What song is Kyoko dancing to in Puella Magi / Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica? I've just been re-watching Puella Magi Madoka Magica / Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica (episodes, movie, doesn't change this situation). I noticed a song that sounded quite nice, that Kyoko was dancing to (playing Dance Dance Revolution, if you're happy to go by that name) in the 6th episode, or at 1:20:25 roughly, during the first movie. I'd like to make it clear that I am referring to the first song she dances to, not the second. I am well aware that the second song is Connect by ClariS.\nThe scene can be found at this link. It starts right near the beginning. What is this song / tune? Does anyone know the name, artist, or what it is from, if it is known outside of Madoka Magica?\nThanks in advance,\n", "post_id": "14427", "cluster_id": 475, "novelty": true, "order": 0}

Do these Madoka original soundtrack disks have some comprehensible melodies printed on them or are they just random notation signs? If it is possible, I'd like to hear what is written on them.\n\n\n", "post_id": "14847", "cluster_id": 475, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
