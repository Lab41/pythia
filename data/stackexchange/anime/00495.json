{"body_text": "Is there a canon timeline to CLAMP works? I keep reading that alot of CLAMP's works are set in encompassing universe kinda like TYPE-MOON's Nasuverse particularly how Y\u016bko in xxxHolic seems to interact with Syaoran from Tsubasa Chronicle and has some sort of relationship with Clow Reed, the sorcerer who created the Clow Cards in Cardcaptor Sakura. also Tsubasa Chronicle seems to cross into X/1999 at one point.\nI am wondering, are there canon timelines for watching/reading CLAMP Material? an example from the Nasuverse would be Mahou Tsukai no Yoru -> Fate/Zero -> Tsukihime -> Fate/Stay Night -> Fate/Hollow Ataraxia -> Alliance of Illusionary Eyes -> Kagetsu Tohya -> Melty Blood\n", "post_id": "9984", "cluster_id": 495, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
