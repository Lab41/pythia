{"body_text": "Does making a TV anime series cost less than making a typical TV series? According to this post, 10 million yen per episode is the minimum price for making an anime. I am wondering how this price compares to making a typical TV series that film human actor?\nI guess if the story includes lots of special effects (story like Harry Potter which needs special effect for magic, or story like Star Wars where most background needs CG), it doesn't cost much when making anime as those are still drawings after all. It may cost a bit more if there are battle scenes, but compared to filming using human actor, anime should be a lot cheaper to make?\n", "post_id": "29441", "cluster_id": 1596, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
