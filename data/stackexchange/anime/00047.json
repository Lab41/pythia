{"body_text": "Do many anime play the main theme during the final battle? While watching an anime series with a friend, he pointed out that \"all anime play their theme song during the final fight.\" Now, I doubt it's \"all\", but sure enough, the main theme song of Digimon Tamers and the (first) OP of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood play during the final epic clash in their respective series. (And I'm sure there are many other examples.)\nDo most anime do this? Is there a reason for it (as opposed to just playing a new epic piece)?\n", "post_id": "2997", "cluster_id": 47, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Are songs written for anime openings or endings? I know that some songs in anime openings or endings come from popular J-Pop singers/albums (such as the Bleach opening Rolling Star by Yui). However, some opening songs seem to show up during the show, such as themes appearing during final battles. Are opening or ending themes generally written specifically for the show or are they taken from popular Japanese songs.\n", "post_id": "3070", "cluster_id": 47, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
