{"body_text": "Can a person who influences others lives be killed by a Death Note? There's a rule, that a death note entry can't lead to another's dead.

{"body_text": "Killing Conjoined Twins using Death Note There are Mr. A and Mr. B. They are conjoined twins who each has their own set of organs except for the heart. I write the name of Mr. A while imagining his face, with the cause of death being falling from the top of Tokyo Tower head first. Let's say the difference in height between the two is less than 1 cm. Will Mr. B also die?\nAccording to How to Use: XXVI, item 2:\n\nThis question is a bit different than the one proposed as possible duplicate. In the proposed question, the death of the pilot or the surgeon doesn't necessarily means that the people in the plane or the one in the surgery will 100% die. There is a delay before they actually die. Surgery is rarely done by only one doctor. It usually is done by a team of doctors, so the other doctors can still save the patient. Flying a plane is also the same. There is also the co-pilot. In the case of my question, killing Mr. A is the same as killing Mr. B since they share the same heart with no delay whatsoever to save Mr. B.\n", "post_id": "21874", "cluster_id": 769, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
