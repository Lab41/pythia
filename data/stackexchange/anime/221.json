{"post_id": "14013", "novelty": true, "cluster_id": 221, "order": 0, "body_text": "A manga about a boy and co. using their power to open blue portal to fight against robot-like aliens The main character has a band aid on the nose. He fights robot-like aliens that all look the same except for the boss who is red. The hero is helped by other teenage characters and they all have superpowers. For example, the main character can make a blue portal appear before him (they all do but the effects vary) and can speed up things (like his father who died in a car accident, but turned out to have powers too).\nI remember the first fight when the hero finds out about his powers. He was against a bunch of robots put together in the form of a wrecking ball, and he took it down by shooting a can at the robot leader through the portal.\nLater on, the heroes learn to use metallic guns or something. And in the last episode, the hero fights the villain while his mother and sister are watching him on TV.\nGOD! That was long. Anyway, thanks for helping me.\n"}
