I have Bakemonogatari and Nisemonogatari, and learned that Monogatari Series Second Season is being streamed by Aniplex, which means that Nekomonogatari would have been streamed at some point and that it would get a home release.\nSo, I am wondering what the story's in-universe chronological order is: should I watch Bakemonogatari, Kizumonogatari (when it's released), Nekomonogatari (when it's released), Monogatari Series Second Season (when it's released) and Nisemonogatari?\n", "post_id": "4695", "cluster_id": 593, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
