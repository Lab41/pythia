When she gets there, she realizes that her aunt rented out the house to three or four guys. One of them plays baseball and is in her grade.\nThe title used to be on myanimelist.com's reverse harem list until they changed the format of the website. Also it is not Nadeshiko Shichi Henge (a.k.a. The Wallflower). It's older. If you can help, it'll be great.\n"}
