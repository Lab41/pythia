{"post_id": "22300", "novelty": true, "cluster_id": 349, "order": 0, "body_text": "Anime or anime movie about a girl who ends up on a (flying) island I am 16 right now and I watched this anime when I was around 6 or 7, around the years 2005/2006. Even then, this anime looked old - like, Lupin the Third old.\nAnyway, it was on VHS and all I can remember about it was that in the beginning of the first episode, a girl was either chasing or being chased by two or three people. She may have been an aviator, but I am not so sure about this. She wore a primarily tan coloured outfit.\nThe girl somehow ends up on an island, which might have been a flying island. After she crash-landed on the island, she ran into this thing (can't remember, might have been human, might have been not). There was a tree in the middle of the island and it played a huge role in the story, though I've forgotten exactly how. At some point later in the story the bad guys found her and ended up trying to kill said tree.\nIn retrospect, it might have been a standalone movie. Either way, I am dying to know and I've been scouring the internet for clues, but to no avail. Please help!\n"}
