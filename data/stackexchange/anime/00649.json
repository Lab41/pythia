{"body_text": "Why are there so many fillers in long-running animes? The most obvious answer everyone over the Internet is giving to this question is \"Because anime is produced much faster compared to manga, they need to put in fillers in order to slow down the anime series\". However, that shouldn't be the only reason.\nFor example, consider One Piece. The show is going on for more than 500 episodes, and less than 10% are fillers. Comparing that to Naruto, the show has almost the same number of episodes (original and Shippuuden combined), but almost 50% of its episodes are fillers. Needless to say, the manga of Naruto is so far ahead that the anime won't be able to catch up even if they produce 100+ episodes without any fillers. \n", "post_id": "336", "cluster_id": 649, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "What are the main reasons for filler episodes? This isn't a question about a specific anime. However, I wonder why filler episodes exist.\nAt first, I thought it was to allow the manga to advance a bit more when the anime was catching up. However, in Naruto (for example), the manga has finished and the anime still has fillers.\nFor other series like One Piece, the anime is relatively close to the manga and there are no fillers (Thanks God!)\nWhat's the purpose of filler episodes?\n", "post_id": "19932", "cluster_id": 649, "novelty": false, "order": 1}
