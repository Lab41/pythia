{"body_text": "Is Misa Amane's early death a plothole in Death Note? According to the wiki, when a Shinigami dies, their remaining lifespan is given to the human they saved.\nSince Rem killed L and Watari, she gained their remaining lifespans. Additionally she probably still had some lifespan left. On top of that Misa was already given a lot of lifespan from Gelus (from which she lost 75% again). So does this mean all of this lifespan is transferred to Misa Amane?!\nYet according to her wiki page, she dies in 2011 at the age of 26, only seven years after Rem died.\nDoes this mean that humans are also capable of reducing their own lifespans? Or would the author have made a mistake by letting Misa die as early as she has? I know she lost 75% of her remaining lifespan through the two eye deals, but you'd think that the cumulation of L, Watari and Rem's remaining lifespans would be greater than just one year, wouldn't you?\n", "post_id": "11296", "cluster_id": 392, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
