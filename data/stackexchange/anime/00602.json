{"body_text": "How did Goten and Trunks become Super Saiyan so easily? Most Saiyan (Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, etc.) who evolved into Super Saiyan had trouble fulfilling one of the requirements to evolve: Their rage or other emotions had to be extreme.\nHowever, there are two exceptions: Goten and Trunks (not the Trunks from the future).

Related to this, but I would like to know specifically for (young, not future) trunks and goten, how they managed to become super saiyans at such a young age - the others all went through a stressful emotional event that pushed them over the edge, yet while these two were growing up, I can't imagine them going through anything similar - there was no villain at the time. \n\n", "post_id": "18878", "cluster_id": 602, "novelty": false, "order": 1}
