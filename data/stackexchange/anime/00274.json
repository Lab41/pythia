{"body_text": "Has an anime ever come out before the manga was published? I got into a debate with a friend about whether or not it's possible for an anime to come out before its manga.\nHe claimed that there were several instances where the anime actually preceded the manga. Is this the case? \nP.S.: I know that there are several anime without a manga. I also know that there are manga created from games. That's not what I'm asking. I'm asking whether or not there is a series where the anime came before the manga.\n", "post_id": "2351", "cluster_id": 274, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
