{"body_text": "The Tree of Life in Evangelion I've noticed references to the Kabbalah in a couple of anime I've watched.  One of them is Neon Genesis Evangelion.\nNeon Genesis Evangelion has it in the sky in both the opening credits and in the series itself:\n\n\nI also remember it was on the ceiling at NERV, but the best screencap I could find of that was too tiny to be visible.\nSo, my question is, Is there any deeper meaning to the use of the Kabbalistic tree of life, or is it just used because it looks cool?\n", "post_id": "4784", "cluster_id": 122, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Is there some deeper meaning associated with all the religious symbolism in Evangelion? It just seems like they put all those symbolism for no reason, and it sounds and looks pretty stupid IMO. The series would have been a lot better without all the nonsense.\n", "post_id": "5000", "cluster_id": 122, "novelty": false, "order": 1}
