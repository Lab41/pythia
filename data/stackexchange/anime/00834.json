{"body_text": "Are guns in Kenshin historically accurate? I noticed:\n\nPrivate citizens with small pistols\nPrivate citizens with hand-cranked machine guns\nSoldiers of the old order with guns killing Sano's friends\nSoldiers of the new order storming Yutaro's mansion after the rebels camped in it\nRevolutionary soldiers practising stabbing motions with special sticks, while the teenage Kenshin practises swordsmanship in Trust and Betrayal\n\nSeems like the opposing factions could acquire guns in the Kenshin universe; it seemed to come from totally unregulated trade with foreigners, or the same army which is in #2, #3 and maybe #4. Is this historically accurate? Where did they all get their guns from?\n", "post_id": "19525", "cluster_id": 834, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Who is Saigo-san? In Episode 7 of Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai Ren, Shinka and her friends are on a school trip in Kagoshima. They see a statue of someone called Saigo-san. One of the friends complains that he doesn't have his dog, and Shinka tells her that he doesn't have a dog in Kagoshima.\n\n\nLater, they find a dog so they can hold it and take a picture in front of the statue.\nInterestingly, Saigo-san appears to have European features. I know that Kagoshima is on the island of Kyushu at the far south of Japan. The south hosted a Dutch enclave for years after the foreigners were expelled from Japan under the Tokugawa shogunate. I assume he's some kind of historical figure, but who is he and what's the deal with the dog?\n", "post_id": "22437", "cluster_id": 834, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
