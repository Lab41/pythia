But if he can't reanimate him, what was the point of the coffin? To perform reanimation, he needs a host first. He must have reanimated him earlier on a host if it was possible. So what was the point of summoning that coffin?\nAccording to the Naruto wikia's page on Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation (specific revision),\n\nTo perform this technique, the user must first acquire some of the DNA of the person they intend to reincarnate. Kabuto remarks that this basically amounts to grave-robbing, although blood stains or organs salvaged after the target's death also work. The soul of the intended reincarnated must also reside in the pure world (\u6d44\u571f, j\u014ddo); for example, those whose souls have been consumed by the Death God cannot be reincarnated. However, if it is a case where the souls are freed from inside the Shinigami, then a user of this technique is free to reincarnate them once again.\nNext, a living sacrifice is required for the soul of the reincarnated to use as a vessel.\n\n"}

In the battle between Sarutobi Hiruzen and Orochimaru during the Chunin Exams, (on the rooftop where the Sound Four sealed them in a barrier) Orochimaru summoned the two previous Kages.

Because that time, he was still under the Shiki Fuujin Seal.\n"}
