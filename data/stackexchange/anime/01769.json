{"body_text": "Why does Naruto have a catch phrase? In both the anime and manga Naruto often ends his sentences with either \"dattebayo\" or \"believe it\" in the English translations. \nWhy is this a thing?\nIs it meant to further his character or provide a bit of remembrance of his character to the reader or viewer, or even other characters of the series?\n", "post_id": "124", "cluster_id": 1769, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Why does Sakura's inner voice say \"cha\" at the end of her sentences? So this answer explains why Naruto say \"dattebayo\" or \"believe it\" in the English translations, being that he inherited it from his mother.\nIn earlier episodes of Naruto when Sakura goes to think of what she really wants to say, this occurs in the form of white drawing lines of Sakura with writing on her forehead with black background. See the image below:\n\nIn the English dub, the second Sakura often ends her sentences by saying \"cha\".\nWhat is the reason for this? Is this something she picked up from her parents like how Naruto inherited his mother's habit, or is there some other explanation for this?\n", "post_id": "31964", "cluster_id": 1769, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
