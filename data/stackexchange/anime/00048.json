{"body_text": "How did Goten and Trunks become Super Saiyan so easily? Most Saiyan (Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, etc.) who evolved into Super Saiyan had trouble fulfilling one of the requirements to evolve: Their rage or other emotions had to be extreme.\nHowever, there are two exceptions: Goten and Trunks (not the Trunks from the future). How did they achieve it? They hadn't seen or done anything that could drive them to such a level of rage/intense emotion to allow them to turn into Super Saiyan.\n", "post_id": "422", "cluster_id": 48, "novelty": true, "order": 0}

As per this Wiki page :\nSo does it mean that even if a Saiyan might reach the energy level that a super Saiyan might have, he'll still not get converted to a super Saiyan unless there is a need? Energy level doesn't determine the ability to become a Super Saiyan, but a need to become one does?\nOn the other hand, as per the discussion on this page, it seems energy level is indeed an important factor.\nIt's confusing.\n", "post_id": "3075", "cluster_id": 48, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
