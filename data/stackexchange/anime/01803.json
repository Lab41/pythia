{"body_text": "Why is Gohan shown to be so weak in Dragon Ball Super? Gohan was the strongest in his mystic form back at the end of DBZ. How could Gohan have become so weak that he lost the ability to turn Super Saiyan 2 in such a short period of time? While on the other hand, Frieza was able to surpass Goku's Super Saiyan Blue transformation in only 4 months of training. That doesn't make sense.\nTagoma was even able to pierce him with a ki blast. Now he is losing left and right in every episode. Most recently Frieza in his base form was shooting ki blasts through Super Saiyan Gohan. So Frieza's base form is stronger than Super Saiyan now? How did that happen?\n", "post_id": "27845", "cluster_id": 1803, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
