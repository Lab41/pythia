{"body_text": "When does one become a Super Saiyan? As per this Wiki page :\nSo does it mean that even if a Saiyan might reach the energy level that a super Saiyan might have, he'll still not get converted to a super Saiyan unless there is a need? Energy level doesn't determine the ability to become a Super Saiyan, but a need to become one does?\nOn the other hand, as per the discussion on this page, it seems energy level is indeed an important factor.\nIt's confusing.\n", "post_id": "3075", "cluster_id": 600, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Was there ever a reason for why becoming a super saiyan became easy for the trunks and goten? Related to this, but I would like to know specifically for (young, not future) trunks and goten, how they managed to become super saiyans at such a young age - the others all went through a stressful emotional event that pushed them over the edge, yet while these two were growing up, I can't imagine them going through anything similar - there was no villain at the time. \n\n", "post_id": "18878", "cluster_id": 600, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
