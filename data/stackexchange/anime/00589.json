{"body_text": "What is the context of this Hunter x Hunter reference in Inou Battle manga chapter 2? In chapter 2 of Inou Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de manga adaptation, we can see that the middle panel makes a reference to Dragon Ball's meme \"It's over 9000!\". The line was actually \"It's over 8000!\" in the original Japanese manga, and this explains why Andou only counts up to 8000. The censored word is Scouter, which is the device to measure power level.\n\nHowever, I don't recognize the reference on the left most panel. Searching for the censored word reveals that it is Menthuthuyoupi from Hunter x Hunter. However, I don't read the manga, so I don't understand the reference.\nWhich scene from Hunter x Hunter does this reference come from? And what is the context that makes it worth referenced by another author?\n", "post_id": "18609", "cluster_id": 589, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
