{"body_text": "Can the Tailed Beasts' relative power levels be compared? A Tailed Beast's power seems to be greater the more tails it has. For example:\n\nPower of 3-Tailed Beast = Power of 2-Tails + 1-Tails.\nPower of 9-Tailed Beast = Power of 8-Tails + 7-Tails + ... + 1-Tails.\n\nThis is clear. But is it possible to compare the power level of the 1-Tails and 2-Tails with this equation? Does the power of the 2-Tailed Beast = the power of the 1-Tailed one? Or is it greater?\nReference links:\n\nMost of them have shared the same idea in this link.\nBadranious's answer in this thread.\n\n", "post_id": "1940", "cluster_id": 453, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
