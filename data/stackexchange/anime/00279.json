{"body_text": "Why didn't Sarutobi kill Danzo? As I'm watching these filler episodes, I am wondering, why was Danzo still alive, after doing all the things he did to The Third? He hid a Wood style user, he tried to assassinate Sarutobi (not even once), he tried to lure the Anbu forces to join the Federation, he tried to manipulate the Hokage election after the death of Minato, and so on (just from these couple of episodes, without mentioning the whole \"rivalry\" between them).\nThe Third was aware of the situations, since he warned Danzo a lot of times. So even if he was a member of the Hokage's council, why did Sarutobi endure the disrespect and danger that came from Danzo? I would've been pleased even with a ban from the Village, but given what he had done, Sarutobi could've eliminated Danzo without any efforts.\n", "post_id": "8202", "cluster_id": 279, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Does Danzo use a curse mark? I totally understand what the Curse Mark is about, but I never knew that Danzo uses them like Orochimaru does. Not until some of the more recent episodes. I didn't even know The Foundation had access to such jutsu.\nI always thought that the Curse Mark was something that only Orochimaru uses, and that Danzo used a \"Sealing Jutsu\" on Foundation Members. So who actually created the Curse Mark?\n", "post_id": "8339", "cluster_id": 279, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
