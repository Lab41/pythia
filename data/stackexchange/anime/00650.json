{"body_text": "Why is anime produced faster than manga? Anime is colorful. It has voice and music. It contains tens of thousands of frames. It requires advanced computer software and high level of technology.\nOn the other hand, manga is nothing but a drawing with pen and pencil.\nI would expect manga to be produced faster than anime under these conditions. However, it appears to be not the case. In most long running series, anime eventually catches up to the manga.\nIs it because the mangakas are lazy, or is there another reason behind this?\n", "post_id": "19930", "cluster_id": 650, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Why are there so many fillers in long-running animes? The most obvious answer everyone over the Internet is giving to this question is \"Because anime is produced much faster compared to manga, they need to put in fillers in order to slow down the anime series\". However, that shouldn't be the only reason.\nFor example, consider One Piece. The show is going on for more than 500 episodes, and less than 10% are fillers. Comparing that to Naruto, the show has almost the same number of episodes (original and Shippuuden combined), but almost 50% of its episodes are fillers. Needless to say, the manga of Naruto is so far ahead that the anime won't be able to catch up even if they produce 100+ episodes without any fillers. \n", "post_id": "336", "cluster_id": 650, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
