{"body_text": "How did the birds come back to life when Envy arrived? After Cornello had been eaten by Gluttony, the townspeople search for him but find a lot of dead birds. Envy arrives as Cornello and passes off a miracle and claims that the Cornello who had been \"conning\" everyone was sent by the devil while \"he\" was out of town. The miracle he performs is bringing the birds back to life, but out of everyone's view in the sky the birds explode.\nNow I can understand how it's possible if alchemy was used, however, none the homunculi can use Alchemy except for Wrath, because:\n\n His arm and leg belong to Ed, and as such can create an array with them since \"the truth\" was engraved into Ed's body and he had only lost one limb at that time.\n\nSo I am wondering, how did those birds come back to life?\nEDIT: I'm referring to the original (first produced).\n", "post_id": "5480", "cluster_id": 1660, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "How is the use of the red stones able to bypass equivalent exchange? In the 2003 series, we see on different occasions that the red stones are used as an unstable alternative to the philosopher's stone despite the fact that they do not have any souls entrapped in them. They're just artificially synthesised.\nIf so, why was prophet Cornello able to apparently bypass equivalent exchange using the red stones? More controversial is the revival of birds by alchemy using a red stone. Why are homunculi fed with red stones as a source of souls? It all just doesn't add up.\n", "post_id": "29956", "cluster_id": 1660, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
