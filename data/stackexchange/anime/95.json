Since the story is pirate-themed, I thought it may be at the time of the Golden Age of Piracy. The Golden Age of Piracy spans from 1650s to the 1730s. So I thought it happened around that time. Am I right or do they have their own timeline?\n"}

It's a side story titled Enel's Great Space Operations. But I'm wondering how can he reach the moon? \nFirst, he goes to space where there is no air, how can he breath? \nSecond, it's a really long distance, the distance between earth and moon is 384,400 km (238,900 miles). And considering that One Piece takes place in the sixteenth century, the average speed of a ship at that time was less than 10 knot (18.52 kph/11.5 mph), it will take more than 2 years to reach the moon with a ship like that.\nThird, can't he just use his power to reach the moon? (I don't know if lightning can go through space or not, maybe Kizaru can do it better?)\n"}
