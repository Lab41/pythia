{"body_text": "Is there a significance in the names of the artificial spirits? Each of the Rozen Maiden Dolls has an artificial spirit. Since there is so much in this series that has a deeper meaning of some sort (episode titles and doll names jump to mind) I\u2019m assuming that their names will also have a deeper meaning \u2014 especially since there are names such as Pizzicato (Kanaria\u2019s artificial spirit) that are clearly not Japanese at all.\nThe only one that partially makes sense to me though, is Berrybell, Hina-Ichigo\u2019s artificial spirit which fits into the general word-cloud strawberry.
