{"body_text": "When and why did the trend of 1:30-long openings and endings begin? I've started to notice lately that the vast majority of anime (that I can find, anyway) seems to have opening (OP) and ending (ED) sequences which are 1 minute and 30 seconds long.\nSome examples (though I'm sure there are lots that I haven't covered):\n\nFullmetal Alchemist: There are 5 OPs and 5 EDs, all of which are 1:30 long.\nDigimon Tamers, Steins;Gate: Both OP and ED are 1:30.\nGaoGaiGar and Neon Genesis Evangelion: The OPs are 1:30 long, though the EDs are only 1:00 in duration.\nCardcaptor Sakura: The OPs are 1:30, did not check the ED durations.\n\nThere do seem to be some exceptions (again, far from an exhaustive list):\n\nOne Piece: Though some episodes fit this pattern, others have 3-minute OPs and no EDs. (The combined duration is still the same, though.)\nAkagi, Kaiji: OP is shorter than 1 minute.\nGa-rei: Zero, Aria: During the OP or ED music (which is 1:30 long), things unrelated to the OP/ED sequence happen (like actual parts of the episodes).\n\nThese lists are just examples of each, and don't really show that the vast majority of anime (I would wager 90% or higher) seem to follow the 1:30 OP/ED \"rule\".\nIt is worth noting that most American series have openings which are 30 seconds or 1 minute in length; Family Guy and the Sonic the Hedgehog cartoon are examples of this, though there are far more.\nWhen did the 1 minute 30 second duration of OPs and EDs start to come into popularity, and is there a particular reason why they did so?\n", "post_id": "2597", "cluster_id": 163, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Why are almost all anime episodes 20 minutes long? Why are all animes around 20 minutes long?
