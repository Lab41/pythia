I've watched the Vampire Knight anime three times now. \nI really like the story so far but find it frustrating that the anime doesn't finish off the story. I'm trying to figure out if it is worth reading the manga.\nDoes the manga contain more story than the anime? \nAnd does it finish the story off?\nNo spoilers please.\n"}

I bought 17 volumes of the manga from Madman in Australia, and only recently did I get an email from them advertising an 18th volume.\nI thought Vampire Knight had ended, but if volumes are still being released in Japan, then it'll take some time before they are translated and reprinted so it's ongoing. However, if it's finished in Japan then new English volumes are just catching up to the end, either way the translation is slow (I bought the 17 volumes back in March this year during a sale).\nSo I'm wondering: Is Vampire Knight still being written or has it finished in Japan?\n"}

A rather straightforward question, but how well did both the anime and manga sell?  Where they both popular?  What was the account if units sold for the anime each season?
