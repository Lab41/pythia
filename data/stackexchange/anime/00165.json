{"body_text": "How is the passage of time handled in Pokemon? I stopped following the Pokemon anime a while ago, but I know the series has had Ash go through many regions, including retreading at least one of them.  When Ash was about to get his eight badge, Misty mentioned that they'd been on the road for a year at that point.\nI saw some recent episodes, and Ash looks nearly identical to when he first started as a trainer.  Normally I'd attribute that to cartoon sitcom logic, where the characters never age; but in a series with continuity and references to earlier seasons, this makes no sense.\nWhat's the official word on a timeline for the Pokemon anime?\n", "post_id": "2358", "cluster_id": 165, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
