{"body_text": "What is Natsu hiding under the bandage on his right arm after he came back from the training since chapter 418? In chapter 418, when Natsu came back to Magnolia, you can see that he had both his arms bandaged. He took off the bandage on his left arm when he went to Lucy's house. However, he never took off the one on his right arm.\nUp to chapter 446, the latest chapter at the time of writing, I have not fount a point when he took off the bandage on his right arm. He wasn't bandaged prior to chapter 418, before he started the training. This leads me to suspect that he has something on his right arm which he doesn't want other people to see.\nWhat is he hiding under the bandage on his right arm?\n", "post_id": "23585", "cluster_id": 964, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
