{"body_text": "Which Trinity Universe Characters belong with each developer? In Trinity Universe a number of characters from games developed by Gust and Nippoin Ichi Software (NIS) are featured in it. some are obvious but i am wondering which characters belong to which developers and which may be original characters.\nBellow is a List of characters:\n\nDemon God (Dog) King Kanata\nFox Spirit Tsubaki\nSuzaku\nDark Hero Lucius\nValkarie Rizelea\nMizuki\nViolet\nPamala\nMacaroon\nMiyu\nRecit\nPirate Queen Etna\nPrinny (and in cutscenes, the Prinny Squad)\nFlonne (Fallen Angel)\n\nNOTE: i have tagged atelier and disgaea because i am assuming the characters would originate from these series\n", "post_id": "14153", "cluster_id": 447, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Who is Macaroon? In a side quest of the first Hyperdimension Neptunia game, you fight a boss called Macaroon. Here's an image of her (unsure if this is from the original or Re;Birth)\n\nIn Trinity Universe, she appears as an Inn Keeper (before Pamula takes over) and as a shop keeper (before Violet takes over).\n\nI've played though the Disgaea Games (with the exception to Disgaea D2: a Brighter Darkness, but it was released after Trinity Universe and Hyperdimension Neptunia) and I haven't seen her, so I assumed that she is a Gust character probably from the Atelier series, since both games feature Gust characters (Hyperdimension Neptunia has a character who represents Gust called Gust like how NISA has Nisa).\nI thought she'd appear in the Atelier Iris series, but I'm currently on the third one and I have yet to meet her, but I know some of the Atelier Games were never localized and I'm assuming she's from the Atelier series (Gust also did Ar Tonelico and Ar no Surge).\nSo I am wondering, where does she appear? Or was she an original character only used in cross-over works?\n", "post_id": "14154", "cluster_id": 447, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
