{"body_text": "How were the walls in Attack on Titan built? If I remember correctly, in Attack on Titan, it's mentioned or implied a number of times that humans built the walls to protect themselves from the titans. (Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on this.) If so then, how did they manage to get the walls erected (which seem to be the result of somewhat extensive work) without getting killed, if they were already under attack by that point?\n(Note: I'm only about halfway through the anime series, so I might just be missing something that appears later.)\n", "post_id": "7551", "cluster_id": 568, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Why didn't the Titans wipe out humanity yet? It seems like the Titans have a really huge advantage like the colossal, armored, female Titan. They could probably charge at Wall Sina instantly, take it down and wipe out humanity. The female Titan spared Armin's life a few times, when she could take him out in seconds.  \nSo it seems the Titans are capable of killing all the humans completely but they don't. Why is that so?\n", "post_id": "18362", "cluster_id": 568, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
