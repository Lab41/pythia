{"body_text": "Why do some Sharingan eyes have unique Mangekyou abilities? Itachi, Sasuke, Madara's Sharingan and Danzo's \"Sharingan\" eyes have the \"standard\" Mangekyou abilities of Amaterasu, Tsukuyomi, Susanoo, Izanagi and Izanami. (Granted not all of them have used all the abilities.)  \nHowever, Shisui and Obito's sharingan have unique Mangekyou abilities (Komoamatsukami and Kamui respectively). Why do some Sharingan eyes come with unique abilities? Do they get these abilities in lieu of the standard abilities or in addition to them?  \nObito has always used Kamui and never been shown using the standard abilities, with his Sharingan (he once used Izanagi with a transplanted Sharingan), which makes me wonder if the special abilities are in lieu of the standard ones. \n", "post_id": "846", "cluster_id": 445, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
