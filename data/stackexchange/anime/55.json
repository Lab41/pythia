So, the Monogatari series has four season, and soon will be five, and if we look at the production order, based on this question, and this Wikipedia page it will be: \n\nBakemonogatari (2009\u20132010)\nNisemonogatari (2012)\nNekomonogatari (Kuro) (2012)\nMonogatari Series: Second Season (2013)\nMonogatari Series: Second Season + \u03b1 or Hanamonogatari (2014)\n\nAs you can see, \"Second Season\" is the fourth and fifth season of anime, so why the title \"Second Season\"?\n"}

I have Bakemonogatari and Nisemonogatari, and learned that Monogatari Series Second Season is being streamed by Aniplex, which means that Nekomonogatari would have been streamed at some point and that it would get a home release.\nSo, I am wondering what the story's in-universe chronological order is: should I watch Bakemonogatari, Kizumonogatari (when it's released), Nekomonogatari (when it's released), Monogatari Series Second Season (when it's released) and Nisemonogatari?\n"}

It's rather confusing how the story is serialized not in the order of its events. I'd like to know the order in which the animated versions were produced.\n\nTurns out the creators of the series are very considerate towards the viewers and include several recap episodes in each season. So although the story is out of order, everything still makes perfect sense and you don't have to bother yourself by figuring out the exact timeline of the original.\n"}
