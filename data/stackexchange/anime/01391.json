{"body_text": "What is the purpose of characters shouting out the name of their attack? It seems to me that in a lot of anime (Naruto, Dragon Ball, Gurren Lagann, and Digimon are four that come to mind), characters or creatures who perform an attack tend to shout its name, almost as if necessary to perform such an attack. This seems very counterintuitive\u2014telling your opponent that you're about to use a fireball would open you up to being blocked very easily.\n\nWhy do anime characters tend to shout the names of their attacks?

From the first episode of One Piece Luffy chants \"Gomu Gomu No\" to start his attack, it is also seen in other devils fruit users too.
