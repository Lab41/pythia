{"body_text": "Kirito and his relationships with girls In the first and second seasons of SAO, Kirito seemed to be interested in more than one girl at the same time. At the end they are all friends and such, but they are all jealous of him and he likes them back and all.\nSome would argue Asuna is the real girlfriend, but:\n\nIn the cave with Sinon (SAO II, ep.11, 20:30), Sinon asks \"Is there someone you don't want seeing this?\" Kirito shyly answers no.\nWhile introducing Asuna to Sinon, Kirito only said that Rika and Asuna were his friends. Asuna looked okay, a bit like she was thinking \"Yeah I'm just his friend.\"\n\nThese two occasions got me wondering: is he playing them all at the same time or something? \nWhat I'm asking for is something like a timeline, which shows when Kirito likes whom.\n", "post_id": "19399", "cluster_id": 680, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
