{"body_text": "What happened to the second kira? After Light and Misa were cleared, everyone seemed to just forget about that there's more than one kira. What was up with that? I seem to recall Light instructed Misa to make a response to the task force's kira video, then L deduced that the two kiras have met, then Light and Misa were confined, then Soichiro fake shoots them and then they try to catch Higuchi. While trying to catch Higuchi and thereafter, has everyone just forgotten that there's more than one kira? Did anyone find it suspicious that there seems to have been only one kira around? Maybe they thought that the two kiras were acting as one?\nBased on a comment I made here: Why didn't the Task Force capture Misa Amane?\n", "post_id": "26623", "cluster_id": 1219, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
