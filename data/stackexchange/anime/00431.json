{"body_text": "What's up with the name \"Zerozaki Hitoshiki\"? Inspired by this question asking about the Fire Sisters' boyfriends' ridiculous names, here's another question about the bizarre names that Nisio Isin assigns his characters.\nI'm trying to find any hidden meanings in the name \"Zerozaki Hitoshiki (\u96f6\u5d0e \u4eba\u8b58)\" that relate to his character or part in the story. This character is from the Zaregoto series. The character is a knife-wielding serial killer whom the narrator meets in the second novel and describes as his own mirror image. His name is so ridiculous that even other characters in the book find it ridiculous. I looked up the kanji and the first kanji can be read as \"rei\", which has a meaning related to \"zero\". The second kanji is the same kanji that appears in common spellings of the names \"Yamazaki\" and \"Kanzaki\". The rest of it just puzzles me. I'm wondering if there are more hidden meanings that relate in some way to his personality or his part in the story.\n", "post_id": "13920", "cluster_id": 431, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
