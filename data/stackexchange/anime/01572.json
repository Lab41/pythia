{"body_text": "Is the amount of Christianity portrayed in anime representative of Japan? There are a large number of anime shows that portrays Christianity. Neon Genesis Evangelion shows a lot of Christian symbolism, such as crosses. Shows such as Trinity Cross and Chronos Crusade have nuns/people from the Church.

{"body_text": "Why are crosses so popular in anime and manga? I've recently noticed that I see a lot of \"Crosses\" in manga and anime. I thought it was just because Japan has a lot of Christians as I remember my history teacher telling me how Japanese people once really liked the Bible when Europeans came to explore, until the Shogun or someone of great power closed the gates of Japan and essentially isolated Japan from the outside world. \nSome of the more popular characters that I currently remember are Asuna Yuuki (SAO) in the real world when meeting Kirito and Dracule Hawkeye (One Piece). \nAfter further investigation, I realized Japan was only 1 percent Christian. \nIs there another meaning to the Cross in Japan? \n", "post_id": "29306", "cluster_id": 1572, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
