There are three people , the hero - a young boy and a deer which is actually a girl who is cursed. She becomes a lady at night.Wears a blue african dress and has a dusky skin color. I just cant seem to remember the third person in the party. They fight against an evil which controls mostly african monkeys. Once affected by the evil, the monkey's eyes glow red. If they bite somebody, they get converted to evil. They go on a journey to defeat the evil and solve the each of their problem ex:the girl's curse. One crucial scene I remember is that the tears of the girl actually helps her break the curse. Thanks in advance guys ! :D\n"}
