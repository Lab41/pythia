{"body_text": "Are guns in Kenshin historically accurate? I noticed:\n\nPrivate citizens with small pistols\nPrivate citizens with hand-cranked machine guns\nSoldiers of the old order with guns killing Sano's friends\nSoldiers of the new order storming Yutaro's mansion after the rebels camped in it\nRevolutionary soldiers practising stabbing motions with special sticks, while the teenage Kenshin practises swordsmanship in Trust and Betrayal\n\nSeems like the opposing factions could acquire guns in the Kenshin universe; it seemed to come from totally unregulated trade with foreigners, or the same army which is in #2, #3 and maybe #4. Is this historically accurate? Where did they all get their guns from?\n", "post_id": "19525", "cluster_id": 840, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
