{"body_text": "Can we roughly determine the dates and duration of Otonashi's stay in the Afterlife World? In Otonashi's flashback in episode 9, he was on his way to take the National Center Test for University Admissions, held annually during a weekend in mid-January over a period of two days, when the train he boarded crashed. He took out his mobile phone to check the time and then realized that he was late for the test. Thus, we can conclude that January 15 was a Sunday and Otonashi left the real world on January 21 (Day 7).\n\nDespite being a school-themed anime, there seemed to be little indication of time and the seasons in the Afterlife World when compared to the real world in the flashback episode, where we knew the exact dates (and even the days) of the incidents that were happening. Can we tell the date (or the time of the year) each episode occurred on from the activities the students were doing (or any other hint)? And can we possibly determine the duration of Otonashi's stay in the Afterlife World up till the last episode?\n", "post_id": "19956", "cluster_id": 652, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
