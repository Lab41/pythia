{"body_text": "Is it common for Japanese otaku fans to create AMVs? AMV is the term for Anime Music Videos, MEP is the term for Multi-Editor Project, and MMV is the term for Manga Music Video. Some notable favorites of mine that I watch mostly come from the YouTube channel [[MDS]] or Mad Desire Studios. I have noticed that a lot of AMVs are usually made by western otaku fans of anime - so generally from people from countries like America etc.\nDo Japanese otaku usually create AMVs, MEPs, or MMVs, or is this just common for otaku who come from America?\nNote: If you want to see what an AMV typically looks like, then this (Youtube link) will be good to watch and is one of my favourite AMVs.\n", "post_id": "9851", "cluster_id": 330, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
