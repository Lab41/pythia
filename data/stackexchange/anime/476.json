I would rent the VHS from the local small video rental place. It has haunted me for years that I cannot remember. \nSo there is a tall blonde princess. She puts on, like, a fitting outfit. It's mostly white with pink trim. It's a short skirt and thigh high white boots. She has a helmet and when she touches the circle on it just above her forehead it activates/deactivates the body shield that lets her breath in space. She has a small sceptre the can shoot blasts.\nShe goes to a planet that looks like a wasteland where there's a boy with brown hair trapped in what looks like a half bubble. He is yelling at someone that is talking to him through the bubble. The Princess is coming to rescue him but gets blasted just as she is about to reach him by space monsters. She manages to shoot her sceptre at the bubble, releasing the guy. He has, I think, a white and red space suite. And on each side of his legs is a weapons that looks white and oblong. He raises his hands and they, like, jet themselves into his hands, then he connects them and they become one long stick that shoots blasts. He also has what looks like a flying jet ski. \nI want to say he has 2 sidekicks and one of them is fat.\nCan anyone help?\n"}

The spear guy might have had white armour/suit.\n"}
