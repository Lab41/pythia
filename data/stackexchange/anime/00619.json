{"body_text": "Why are there songs in OSTs and music albums that don't appear in the anime? There are songs from OSTs, or even full albums by bands or singers in the anime, that I have never heard in the anime. Some music albums for which this is true:\n\nNeon Genesis Evangelion: S\u00b2 Works \u2014 many unused songs and alternate mixes or arrangements of existing songs.\nLe Portrait de Petit Cossette Original Soundtrack \u2014 the song my love, so sweet is never used in the OVA.\nKeep the Beats! by GirlDeMo.\nGod only knows -Secrets of the Goddess- \u2014 the full version that is 11 minutes longer than the one used in the OP of The World God Only Knows: Goddesses!\n\nWhy do they do this? For fan service? To make us feel like the bands or singers are real artists? Or to get more profits from CD sales? In which case, couldn't they have just picked the cheaper alternative of selecting some existing songs that are good fits for the anime?\n", "post_id": "6165", "cluster_id": 619, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
