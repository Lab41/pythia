{"body_text": "How do I figure out the contents of doujinshi? I have been to Japan and saw all these doujinshi manga which all look really interesting just by their cover. But how do Japanese people actually figure out the content of these books? There is no plot written anywhere, and you generally cannot open them.\nFor example, I have been reading \u5b64\u72ec\u306e\u30b0\u30eb\u30e1 (Kodoku no Gurume) and I saw doujinshi based on it. Should I think \"the manga was good so let's try this version\"? Or is there somewhere to look at to find out the content?\nDoes it work only by word-of-mouth or are there any resources on the internet we can check to have more information on the different authors and their doujinshi?\n", "post_id": "25708", "cluster_id": 1701, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Is doujinshi always sexual? Sorry if this has an obvious answer, I'm pretty new to the anime community. \nI've seen covers of doujinshi for certain pairings/fandoms I like, but from what I've seen of the contents, most of them get pretty steamy. I really like the concept of fan-published works like this and seeing certain characters interact, but I don't feel comfortable reading something so...explicit? Are there doujinshi that are based around platonic/fluffy romance interactions, or is this typically the standard for doujinshi? (And is there a way I can tell a platonic doujinshi from others?)\n", "post_id": "30580", "cluster_id": 1701, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
