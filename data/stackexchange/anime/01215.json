{"body_text": "What is the viewing order of Fate-related works? I've watched just the 2006 Fate/Stay Night anime series. I know there are other series in the franchise (Fate/Zero, Fate/kaleid Liner Prisma Ilya), as well as the Unlimited Blade Works movie, and the manga. Given that I don't intend to read the VN, what order should I take these works in, and are there any I can skip without losing out?\nEDIT: Some great answers here. I figured there might be some confusion about my unwillingness to read the VN. It's not about the H scenes or the translation patches; it's just an issue of access. I'm not quite willing to spend the $130 to import it, even though I know I would love it if I did. (I read and loved the Tsukihime VN; just don't ask me how I got it.)\n", "post_id": "12832", "cluster_id": 1215, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
