{"body_text": "Is Shanks Haki different from other users? What is Shanks' power? If \"Haoshoku Haki\" then is it different from other users? \nThis question came to my mind after rewatching all episodes of One Piece. \nShank's Haki seemed to be different from that of others. When Shanks was going to meet White Beard before the Ace's death, he cracked the wood even though he wasn't using Haki. \nLike Luffy, he too needs to use his Haki to effect someone but Shanks didn't use it and  yet everybody on board the ship was affected.\n", "post_id": "9801", "cluster_id": 611, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "How does Haki work? Haki seems to not only affect the Devil Fruit user, but also all the other weak enemies. What is the mystery behind it? It seems like willpower but there are so many different types. I have read through One Piece Wiki but I still haven't got a clear picture. \n", "post_id": "18976", "cluster_id": 611, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
