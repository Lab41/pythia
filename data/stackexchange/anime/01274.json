{"body_text": "Apps for offline manga reading Recently my partner has grown very fond of Anime/Manga of all sorts. She has several applications on her iPhone allowing her to view manga. I would like to know what you all believe the best method is, to perform:\n\nBuy Manga sets in an electronic form, such as Naruto Season 1;\nHave an application (iPhone and Windows preferably) to allow us to categorise the manga; e.g. By Rating, Type, Language etc. ;\nAllow transfer of library between platforms so that we can read on Windows and iPhone\n\nHere is an example:\nI buy Naruto, Season 1 in electronic format and download it to PC as *.mobi, *.pdf\nI then edit fields such as category, author, rating, etc. \nI then sync with my iPhone using App_X \n\nNow I understand that there are plenty of online sites where you can read Manga, but I want to be able to own the manga titles and be able to access them offline, on the road etc. \nI had a look for Book Crawler for iOS which seems like a wonderful application for book management in the sense of \"what have I read and what did I rate:, but not for what I need. \nViz seems like my best option to own the Manga. I am not entirely sure if there are any cheaper alternatives on the market. If I buy via their application then it appears that I am locked onto an iPhone to read the manga. Fair enough, she never uses a computer however I'd like to be able to edit it.\nI've used applications like Calibre to edit and tag my books before on Android..so I was hoping for some integration with iPhone to PC.\n", "post_id": "25959", "cluster_id": 1274, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
