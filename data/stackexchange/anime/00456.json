{"body_text": "What differentiates anime from regular cartoons? In my region, people don't know the difference between anime and regular cartoons. When they see me watching anime, or they hear about it somehow, they say that I'm watching a regular cartoon and hence I'm being childish. Sometimes, they even display sarcastic attitudes, so that giving a serious long explanation wouldn't be possible.\nWhat effectively explains how an anime is different from a regular cartoon?\n", "post_id": "69", "cluster_id": 456, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Is The Legend of Korra anime? I saw a comment online that stated The Legend of Korra is not anime. I kinda know the argument in that \"anime\" refers to only Japanese animation, but is that so? The style of this anime, the humour, and everything about it seems extremely anime. I understand that it was written by Americans and animated in Korea.\nIs The Legend of Korra seriously not considered anime because of this? \nAm I going to have to categorize this into an alternate genre type, so that I can add Archer and Futurama? Is there a genre type for these types of animations like with \"shoujo\", \"shounen\", \"seinen\", and \"josei\"? \n", "post_id": "14429", "cluster_id": 456, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
