{"body_text": "Will a person die when their name is written in the situation of death? The answer by Imprfectluck at this question made me wonder what would happen to people whose name was written down in the details of another persons death. For example: John Doe dies after his date with Jane Doe. The foremost basic rule of the Death Note states that The human whose name is written in this note shall die. So will Jane Doe die?\nWe additionally have rule LIV that states that if you write the cause and details of death on a different page, you need to be thinking of the original victim and would not be able to think both of John and Jane at the same time. This would indicate that you have to choose what will happen. Either you think of John and the details happen, either you think of Jane and she dies. Does a similar rule exist when writing on the same page? Or is writing someone's name in the details of another's death just an exception to that first rule?\n", "post_id": "21687", "cluster_id": 938, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Can you manipulate a person using an alias with the death note? So. Let's say John has a death note. Now there's a killer on the run, and John doesn't know his name and face. Now he writes the name of a criminal in his death note, to indirectly catch the killer. He writes: \nBob Zorto gets stabbed to death, at 12:30, by the serial killer, who uses the alias ''Shadow Killer''. \nCould that actually work?\n", "post_id": "23278", "cluster_id": 938, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
