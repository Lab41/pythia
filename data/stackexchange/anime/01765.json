{"body_text": "Does Kiryuin Satsuki have any infused Life Fibers? I know that Kiryuin Satsuki was experimented on by her parents to infuse Life Fibers into her.  She was too old at the time of the experiment for it to be successful but she was able to wear either Kamui (albeit to a lesser degree than her properly infused sister). I assumed when watching that she was partially infused but I now have no recollection as to whether that was clearly stated.  The wiki seems to clearly state that only her mother and sister have infused Life Fibers.\nDoes she have infused Life Fibers to any degree or is she 100% human?\n", "post_id": "31908", "cluster_id": 1765, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
