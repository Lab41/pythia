I saw a post about \"Creating your own Devil Fruit Powers\".. Most OP would be having two abilities. Then I remember that eating Two Devil Fruits = your body to explode. \nSo.. I was thinking, What would have been the Result if Brook (Alive) would have died by eating a second Devil Fruit? Would his Yomi Yomi no Mi powers activate and revive him and if so, he is a person that was able to eat two devil fruit and live which means, two abilities? \n"}

Is there any possibility of Brook dying?\n\nI mean, you can't really kill him, because his soul always comes back.\nDo you have to destroy his Bones?\nBut if i remember right, the Samurai on Thriller Bark broke a part of his skull. But now it healed, so there is no way that Brook can die?\n"}

As per One Piece logic, a person cannot have 2 Devil Fruit powers. \nThe Yomi Yomi no Mi fruit revives the one who eats it. The powers of this fruit are a one-time use, and has been used up after Brook was revived. Can Brook now have another Devil Fruit?\n"}
