We see that at the end of Boruto the movie, Boruto defeats the enemy by hitting him with what it seems a Ch\u014d\u014ddama Rasengan, (IMHO it looks larger than a Ch\u014d\u014ddama Rasengan) I think naruto infused some of his chakra on borutos jutsu to make it that big, but we see it took time for Jiraiya and Naruto to master the rasengan and Naruto was actually the only one to take it to the next level by adding his wind chakra(at the time). So how can Boruto handle this large amount of chakra? Yes everyone says that Boruto can easily beat Naruto if you compare them at the same genin stage of their lives, but that doesn't mean Boruto is trained to manipulate such an insane amount of chakra. How was he able to pull it off?\n"}
