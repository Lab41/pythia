{"body_text": "Why does Naruto have a catch phrase? In both the anime and manga Naruto often ends his sentences with either \"dattebayo\" or \"believe it\" in the English translations. \nWhy is this a thing?\nIs it meant to further his character or provide a bit of remembrance of his character to the reader or viewer, or even other characters of the series?\n", "post_id": "124", "cluster_id": 218, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Where did \"dattebayo\" come from? In Naruto, at least in the early show, he uses the catchphrase \"dattebayo\" in the Japanese. This question answered on a canon-level where it came from (his mother), but I was wondering where (if anywhere) it came from in terms of the language. I know that there's no direct translation, but is it a sort of portmanteau or version of somebody's name or of some phrase in Japanese?\n", "post_id": "7069", "cluster_id": 218, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
