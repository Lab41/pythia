{"body_text": "Can Pok\u00e9 Balls technically catch humans? In the Pok\u00e9mon franchise (I'll accept answers from any canon source, whether the anime, manga, games or anything else I can't think of), Pok\u00e9 Balls are used to catch Pok\u00e9mon. Could you, in theory, use them to catch a human being? Is there any canon example of someone attempting it (I suppose it has probably occurred at some point in the anime for example)? Is there any canonical factor that makes it technically impossible (such as \"Humans and Pok\u00e9mon are fundamentally different\", but I think I remember that this isn't true) or is it possible in theory but simply not done in practice?\nEDIT : My question is different from the general \"How does a Pok\u00e9 Ball work\" question because I'm specifically asking whether / why it can not catch humans. The answer to the other question does address this, but in passing, and it does not provide any sources, and links to a page that may have been a good source in the past, but is now devoid of any relevant content (or canon quotes) so it doesn't really answer my question.\n", "post_id": "31816", "cluster_id": 1760, "novelty": false, "order": 1}
