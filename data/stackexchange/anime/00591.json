{"body_text": "What does 'Akame ga Kill' mean and why is it called that? Just what the title says, why is the show called Akame ga Kill! and what does it even mean? Akame was just an ordinary member of Night Raid, yet the show is named after her. She wasn't the main Protagonist, she wasn't even the main Waifu! And as this unanswered question mentions here, the only difference was:\n\n She fought Esdeath, the primary antagonist, and ultimately survived.\nSo what does that even mean? Does it mean that Akame is Death itself, or Akame is Dead (Not physically, but mentally - that she is dead inside). But I doubt that either of these interpretations are correct since she acts all cutesy from time to time.\nAs another user points out, a general translation would be Akame Kills, but that would be a very stupid name, wouldn't it? So can anyone help clear this up?\n\nEdit: Even Akame knows something's not right (from AkaKILL Theater Episode 24 - END).\n\n", "post_id": "18739", "cluster_id": 591, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
