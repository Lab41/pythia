{"body_text": "Chakra nature of Tailed beasts As we all know that Kurama's chakra is of the healing nature type. This is known from many mentions about it in the wiki page of Naruto Uzumaki.\nMy question is, what is the nature type of the chakra of the other Tailed beasts?\nNote: This is my thinking why there should have been a nature type to each of the tailed beasts. \nAs we all know that when Rikud\u014d Sennin was about to die, he split his powers among his 2 sons(The older son inherited his powerful chakra and spiritual energy & the younger son inherited his powerful life force and physical energy). Similarly, when creating the 9 tailed beasts from the Shinju, he must have split the chakra based on their nature so that each tailed beasts had a unique natured chakra.\nAny insights on this would be very much welcomed.\n", "post_id": "5671", "cluster_id": 154, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Does a Jinchuuriki gain the nature of his/her tailed beast? I find this question interesting here: Chakra nature of Tailed beasts.\nAnd I saw the comment: Does a Jinchuuriki gain the nature of his/her tailed beast? And if so, does the tailed beast gain the nature of its Jinchuuriki?\nSo to confirm this, I ask a different question.\n", "post_id": "5714", "cluster_id": 154, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
