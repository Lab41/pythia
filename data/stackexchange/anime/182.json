I don't think it should concern me, but I am still curious as to how legal anime streaming sites are. A popular site being AnimeUltima, I've watched probably 300+ different anime just from there. However, when asked if the site I use is legal, I usually respond with, \"yes,\" despite not knowing the answer; this is sort of annoying in itself.\nAnimeUltima as an example, is this site legally subbing and uploading anime?\n"}
