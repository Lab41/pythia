{"body_text": "Is it common for games to get a anime? A lot of anime are based off of the plot of a manga and/or light novels. Sometimes an anime is an original work that gets a manga story afterwards, but that isn't always the case.\nI remember watching Amagami, where you could obviously notice that it was based on a game, and some are even named after the games such as Final Fantasy.\nSo how common is it for a anime to be based of a game? I have only seen it once or twice but is it really that uncommon? Or are they just animated in a way that you won't directly notice that it comes from a game unless you already know so?\n", "post_id": "9209", "cluster_id": 309, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
