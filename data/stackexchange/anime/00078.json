{"body_text": "What are the responsibilities of key staff members in an anime production? With any given series, there's a lot of names and titles being thrown around in the opening and closing credits.\nWhat are the typical key roles (E.g., art director, color-setters (iro shitei), producer, director, series coordinator) and their primary responsibilities? Are there also any roles or departments exclusive or work differently in anime production than in traditional or western animation?\n", "post_id": "2505", "cluster_id": 78, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Are background and foreground delegated separately in anime production? When watching anime, I often believe to notice a relative movement of foreground(ex. characters, props) to the background(ex. landscapes, 2nd plan). I of course focus on the foreground, and only \"register\" the background. I somewhat recollect that in films, finding places to shoot a scene is a \"lesser\" task delegated to younger, less expensive, less creative... people. Then the creative person would evaluate 3-4 options that are presented, and chose one venue which would then be used to shoot the scene. I thus wondered, if drawing the background in anime is done in a similar way, that it is delegated to a certain responsible person, and that the foreground is drawn by the primary artistic responsible - or - are they both done by the same person - or - is there some other delegation of drawing among different people?\n", "post_id": "3941", "cluster_id": 78, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
