If someone is brought back to life with the endo tensi, could they also be brought back with justu's like Outer Path: Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique or what Chiyo used or again with the endo tensi?\nI would like to point out the diffrence between my question and Can reanimated Chiyo use One's Own Life Reincarnation technique?. The latter focuses on the paradox of using a life taking justu on an immortal person, while my asks about bring back someone twice, so that there are two of them at the same time.\nAlso, can you use an endo tensi as a sacrifice for an endo tensi? This way you could have an army with only one sacrifice.\n"}
