{"body_text": "What is the purpose of the Human Instrumentality Project? The Human Instrumentality Project is one of the main plotlines in the Neon Genesis Evangelion original series. However, other than a few speculative mentions, there isn't concrete information as to what purpose it serves. \nWhat purpose does the Human Instrumentality Project serve, why is it necessary, and what part does it plays against the Angels (if any)?\n", "post_id": "454", "cluster_id": 4, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "What references to psychology exist in Evangelion? I've noticed from time to time, references to psychology and psychoanalysis, for example the ironic Hedgehog's Dilemma, as well as the Human Instrumentality Project, which seems just a solution to a fundamental psychological human flaw. Even the last two episodes are a complete psychological de-construction of the main characters.\nWhat another references, maybe even implied ones, exist in the Series? Why the focus, especially on psychoanalysis?\n", "post_id": "537", "cluster_id": 4, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
