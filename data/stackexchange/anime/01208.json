{"body_text": "What is C's World? So throughout my viewing of Code Geass (both seasons) I was under the impression that the people shown here were an alien or ancient civilization that lived on Jupiter and were the source of the Geass powers that had been passed down to certain people on Earth.\nNow I went to the wiki and started to read all these things about C's World and collective unconsciousness and the crazy plan by Charles and Marianne, which I previously assumed was just a plan to make everyone obey and have no free will.  What is the collective unconsciousness (I read Jung and it doesn't seem to relate)? I'm really interested in what that all means and what does this have to do with people's souls and the Code Geass universe's take on life after death and the like.  I don't really understand any of this, somehow I slept through it all.  Also, what was the guarantee that it would succeed? Is the World of C a product of an ancient civilization or is it a mechanism of the Code Geass universe?\nSo can anyone fill me in?  Any official writings about this or explanations?\n", "post_id": "10010", "cluster_id": 1208, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "What exactly is the Code Geass? I have watched the series once and I believe there are quite a few things left unexplained. The powers for instance can be transferred to others by only the people who have the \"Code\" like C.C. or V.V. \nSo what exactly is this code? And was Charles after immortality when he tried to acquire C.C.'s code? He even acquired V.V's code didn't he? So he was immortal. Why was he after C.C.? \n", "post_id": "21725", "cluster_id": 1208, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
