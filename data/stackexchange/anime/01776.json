{"body_text": "Did Klein use the resurrection item on Kirito in episode 9 season 1? At the end of the boss fight Kirito shakes and falls and blacks out. He has that thought of sachi and then wakes up. Asuna said he was out for a few seconds. But everyone is circled around him, the other players had enough time to know how many died. I think Klein saved him, he has the resurrection item. i think the reason why its never mentioned to Kirito is because Klein told the players in the boss room to not say anything thinking Kirito would further hate himself maybe. This would also make sense story wise why the stone is never mentioned again. But im not sure.\n", "post_id": "32093", "cluster_id": 1776, "novelty": false, "order": 1}
