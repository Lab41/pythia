In Sword Art Online, why did Akihiko Kayaba make the game so as to make death permanent? Don't get me wrong, I know that in episode 1 he claims that he would like to \"control this world's fate\".  However, in episode 17, when he says that he \"wanted to make a world free of laws and restrictions\", then why make it so that people must die in real life as well?  Wouldn't that make a real death contrary to his goals?  And if he \"forgot\" somewhere in the middle of the game (as he claims in episode 14), what is the point in continuing further?  Has he no regard for human life?\n"}
