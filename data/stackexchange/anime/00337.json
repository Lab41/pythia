{"body_text": "Does Obito master the Summoning Jutsu? I've seen the recent episode of the anime, and I saw,when Obito summoned Kurama. I'm interested in the fact,that does he got some kind of \"contract\" with some animals/things??(that would mean,that you are really able to summon). I've checked out on the Narutopedia,and it appears only the Gedo Mazo by his name,so the summoning of the Nine-tails,it's a normal(just simple) summoning technique?? Because you must have that kind of bond between you and the summoned animal,which is made with your chakra/blood, just like Naruto did with the toads and it would be weird if you would be able to summon a tailed beast just \"because\"\n", "post_id": "7531", "cluster_id": 337, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "How can Madara summon Kurama? According to the wiki trivia:\nBut how can this possible? Controlling a tailed beast doesn't mean that it can be subject to Summoning Technique.
