{"body_text": "Why is Kairoseki's effect more powerful than the sea? It is said that the Kairoseki is just a solid form of the sea and have the same effect as the sea.\nBut why do Kairoseki weakens and negates devil fruit's power, like when a DF user is handcuffed or touched by it, it drains their energy and they loses their ability(logia's can't transform when handcuffed).\nIn case of sea water, I think it just drains their energy but never negates their ability(e.g. Luffy can still stretch to use elephant gun to knock out Kraken).\nAnd is it ever shown or explained where the Kairoseki came from?\n", "post_id": "5713", "cluster_id": 948, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Why Can Devil Fruit Users Use Their Abilities While Wet My understanding was that the sea is supposed to weaken devil fruit users and rob them of their powers. The One Piece wiki elaborated: \nMy questions:\n\nHow did Ajoki freeze the ocean?\n\n\nMay I emphasize he submerged his hand in the sea to use Ice Age.\nHow did Luffy fight Crocodile while wet at Marine Ford?\n\n\nHe was dripping wet after having fallen into the sea. Does the water not weaken him since he was no submerged? I assumed since sea stone worked just by touching it and it has the same effect a the ocean, then by having part of the ocean \"touch\" him would drain his power.\nAre these just plot holes or am I missing something?\n", "post_id": "23344", "cluster_id": 948, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
