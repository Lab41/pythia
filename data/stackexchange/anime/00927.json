{"body_text": "Is Minato a Jinchuuriki? I wonder why Minato is categorized as a Jinchuuriki, considering the following:\n\nMadara couldn't be Ten-Tails' host because he's re-animated, and he has to force Obito to revive him\nMinato is re-animated, just like Madara, and yet he has half the Kurama inside\n\nIt's possible that he sealed in him half of Kurama before he died, and yet why on earth Kurama wasn't reincarnated\nOr Kurama was sealed in unusual manner that Minato's case defied the norm on sealing tailed beast\n\n\n", "post_id": "5250", "cluster_id": 927, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Why didn't Minato make himself also the Yin-Kurama jinchuuriki? Since Minato used the Eight Trigrams Seal and the Four Elements Seal to seal Yang Kurama into Naruto, why didn't he use the same set of seals on himself to seal the Yin half? Why Reaper Death Seal? Or into Kushina? Seems like a pointless sacrifice. And waste of Yin Kurama's potential.\n", "post_id": "23121", "cluster_id": 927, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
