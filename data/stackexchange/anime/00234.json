{"body_text": "What does chakra physically act like? Chakra sometimes appears physically, as opposed to just being used as the power source for jutsus. Some examples of this are when the Hyuugas are using the Gentle Fist technique or when Naruto is using the Kyuubi chakra. In the first example, the chakra is sometimes used to block things, such as in Neji's Rotation jutsu, while Naruto's chakra has the appearance of fire and has at least once actually burned Sakura. Is there any set rule to how chakra acts physically or what it can or cannot do when not being used as the energy source for a specific jutsu?\n", "post_id": "2931", "cluster_id": 234, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "When can chakra be seen? The answer to this question says that chakra can only be seen in certain cases, when the person is using powerful abilities. This lines up with reactions to people seeing Chidori and being surprised that it can be see. However, there are times when chakra can be seen when it is being built up instead of being used in a jutsu.\nHow does this happen, if chakra only shows up when someone is using a strong ability (such as Chidori)? Or is what Naruto using in the image somehow a different type of chakra?\n\n", "post_id": "7385", "cluster_id": 234, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
