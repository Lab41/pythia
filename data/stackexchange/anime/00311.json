{"body_text": "Why do many characters tend to have crazy hair colors and styles? It's fairly common that anime characters tend to have \"wilder\" hair than most people we see in real life. This can be seen as far back as Neon Genesis Evangelion (though somewhat mild) from the 90s (though some older anime, like Akira, do not have this characteristic).\nThe \"wilder\" hairstyles tend to have interesting colors from throughout the rainbow (pink, blue, green, etc.) that are only seen in real life with dyes or highlights. They also tend to be spikier, another trait not seen in real life (probably because gelling one's hair that way every day is quite tedious).\n\nWhy do anime and manga characters tend to have this spiky, colorful hairstyle? What is the cultural origin of such a style? (And did the growing trend of Japanese teenagers spiking their hair in a similar style originate from this?)\n", "post_id": "2872", "cluster_id": 311, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
