So I cant remember the name of this manga, it's about a girl who was in a plane crash when she was little and needed an eye transplant as a result.

She also wears glasses that were given to her by her doctor she sees for check-ups. But it's bothering me not knowing what it's called! Other details I can think of is that the manga is ongoing and the main girl is in her first year of high school,one of her eyes are darker than the other and she gets a  young new teacher at her school whose older sister died in the plane crash she was in.\n"}
