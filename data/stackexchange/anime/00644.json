{"body_text": "What are the differences between the Akame Ga Kill! manga and anime? First of all, why was the anime completed before the manga? As far as I am aware, the anime is ahead of the latest manga chapters by a large margin.\nI've heard that the anime actually differs from the manga; does this mean we might get a remake like Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood for Fullmetal Alchemist?\nFurthermore, will the manga continue on with Akame's story? Will it explain some of the plot holes that were left unanswered in the anime?\n", "post_id": "16737", "cluster_id": 644, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "How different are the anime and manga versions of Akame Ga Kill? Okay, so I watched all of the Akame Ga Kill anime. My question is should I start reading Akame Ga Kiru (the manga) from the beginning or continue from where they split?  I saw on another post that they split around approximately chapter 48. I understand that the overall plot is similar up until that point, but if there are additional characters or skipped over mini-archs then I want to go back and read it all.  If the anime is completely accurate until chapter 48 then I will just start there.\nAnyone know the answer to this?\n(Please no spoilers from anywhere after the anime splits off)\n", "post_id": "19837", "cluster_id": 644, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
