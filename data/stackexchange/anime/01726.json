{"body_text": "Why do people call the Bijuu \"tailed beasts\" if not all of them have tails? So a couple of days ago I was, as usual, on random websites and, for some reason, ended up in the Naruto Wikia on the Bijuu page. I scanned through the page, not really reading anything on there, as I scrolled down. I ended up at the trivia part of the page, which made me start reading. One particular part got my attention, which said:\nSo we know that Ch\u014dmei has one tail and six wings and Gy\u016bki has eight cephalopod limbs that, I guess, count as tails, for some reason. So if Ch\u014dmei and Gy\u016bki don't really have all 7 or 8 conventional tails (as in not all are actually tails) why do they call them \"Tailed Beasts\"? Or do people just confuse the wings and cephalopod limbs for tails? Or are people just, normally, counting the others, which have all tails, and then mistake the wings and cephalopod limbs for tails?\n", "post_id": "31086", "cluster_id": 1726, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
