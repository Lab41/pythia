At the end of Fate/Zero, why did the Holy Grail materialize for Kiritsugu (Episode 24, 23:30) when Saber, Matou Kariya, Kotomine Kirei and Gilgamesh were still alive? Kirei should still have been alive because he was merely unconscious and watching Kiritsugu's visions within the Grail. According to what Kirei explained to Gilgamesh in order to \"plead for his life\" (Episode 17, 23:30), all seven servants must be \"sacrificed\" before the Grail can be activated.\n"}

In Fate UBW, I think Illya was one as well. (I think it's also the case in Fate/stay night in general, but I'm not sure).\nWhat is a Grail vessel? Is it required to summon the Holy Grail?

It is implied that there were five wars in total, and it's likely that their winners would each have wished for something epic, like immortality or godlike powers, but throughout Fate/Zero and Fate/stay night the world doesn't appear to have been affected at all by previous wishes. Am I missing something?\n"}
