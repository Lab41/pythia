The boy's boxes are translucent blue, and he encases the demon in the box, trapping it, and then destroys the box along with the demon inside. The girl's boxes are green, and she makes multiple long rectangular boxes that pierces through the demon, killing it. \nI remember those with the power to use the boxes have a square imprinted on part of their body. The boy's square mark was on the backside of his hand. It's quite an old anime, since the time I saw it was a couple of years back.\n"}
