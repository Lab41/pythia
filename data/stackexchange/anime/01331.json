{"body_text": "How was Kakashi Hatake able to survive and become the next Hokage after losing his Sharingan? I hardly read the manga. I watch the anime series, Naruto: Shippuden. In episode 424, Kakashi's Sharingan (previously Obito's Sharingan) is stolen by Madara. Then in episode 425, Naruto uses his new power and give Kakashi's old eye (as far I know and from my view, it is a normal eye).\nKakashi is the Copy Ninja. So how could Kakashi survive in the ninja world and become the next Hokage (I watched The Last: Naruto the Movie) with normal eyes? I'm curious because Kakashi's nickname was given because he used his Sharingan for copying others' jutsu. That was his technique. As I can remember in Naruto series, someone described Kakashi and told that the only jutsu he mastered by himself was the Chidori.  \n", "post_id": "24274", "cluster_id": 1331, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Are there other Sharingan users who can copy other jutsu besides Kakashi? After I have read this question, I remember that Kakashi's epithet is Copy Ninja because he has a Sharingan in his left eye that was given to him by Obito.\nBut I can't think of another Sharingan user who can also copy other jutsu. So, is that the only special technique that Kakashi's Sharingan had, or there's another Sharingan user who also can copy other jutsu?\n", "post_id": "27621", "cluster_id": 1331, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
