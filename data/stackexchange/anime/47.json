I've only seen bits and pieces of One Piece, but I know that Devil Fruit users (people who have eaten a Devil Fruit) can't swim. I never understood why, though. How does this work? It doesn't seem to give arm or leg disabilities, so what would keep them from being able to swim?\n"}

It is known that the Yomi Yomi no Mi fruit will only revive its user once, and also that Devil Fruit users can't swim, so I was wondering... What would happen if Brook falls into the ocean? I mean, even if he's alive, as a skeleton he has no lungs, so he should just be unable to go back to the surface, shouldn't he?\n"}
