{"body_text": "Was Lelouch the person driving the cart in the last scene of Code Geass R2? At the ending of Code Geass R2, the last scene showed someone whose face wasn't showed riding a horse-pulling-cart with CC. I believe that it is indeed Lelouch (who was previously stabbed by Suzaku wearing Zero's uniform as part of their Code Zero plan to free Elevens), and that he had gained immortality because of his frequent usage of his Geass. \nLelouch's Geass first leveled-up the episode when he accidentally ordered his sister Euphemia to kill all Elevens. Then, his father King Charles was beaten by him and I'm thinking that King Charles' immortality was transferred to him. \nIf that person was really Lelouch, then, has he already gained immortality by that time? \n", "post_id": "116", "cluster_id": 437, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
