Today I'd like to know what kind of proposition one has to make to a Japanese publisher to have a go at distributing a title in a certain country (outside of Japan).\nThis article told me how things work in the industry and I pretty much understand that to get a deal, you need sales forecasts, a  distribution channel, a printer \u2026 ready to work for you. And you need to be able to tell the Japanese publisher how much he\u2019s going to make throughout the coming months by trusting you to distribute his manga.\nWhat I can\u2019t seem to find though, is what a serious or standardized proposition in the industry is. I mean, what are the rules?! Are there rules stating that no matter what, a certain percentage of your margins should go to the Japanese publisher? Are there predefined sales volumes under which you won\u2019t get a deal? Has anyone here actually seen such a contract? Where can one get his/her hands on one? What about digital distribution?\nIf any of you can point me in the right direction, tell me who I should ask this to, or highlight existing documentation, I would be absolutely delighted.\n"}
