These series all seem to be connected, but asides from sharing the same production company and having the semi-colon separate their titles I can't see any relation between them.

Can anyone explain the connection between these series for me?\n", "post_id": "4354", "cluster_id": 867, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Chaos;Head, Steins;Gate, Robotics;Notes: where is all the extra information? To make it short:\nI watched all three anime adaptations, but after browsing the questions here for 5 minutes I feel like I don't know anything about them...\nWhere is all this extra information hidden? \n(More specific question:)\nI am searching for information about 2 things.\n\n\"Hidden\" information which is only for one story.\n\"Hidden\" information which is cross-story (at least two stories \"combined\")\n\nNow I'll specify what I mean with that.\n\n(This example is not related to the stories in the title.) For example, something like the real name of L (from Death Note).\nSomething like \"What is DaSH?\"\n\nI do NOT want you to list all the secrets and easter-eggs! I only want to know where, and (maybe) how to find them. If there are manga with extra information, please give me the title. Or if there are articles on the internet about it, please give me a link.\n(I know that there are visual novels for all the stories listed in the title. I'm going to watch/read/play them soon.)\n", "post_id": "22737", "cluster_id": 867, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
