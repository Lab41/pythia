{"body_text": "Where do Kekkei Genkai abilities (genetic abilities) originate from? In Naruto there is a group of abilities called Kekkei Genkai (\u8840\u7d99\u9650\u754c). They are told to be \"genetic\" abilities which are (usually) passed down genetically within specific clans. \nNotably, the eye techniques (D\u014djutsu, \u77b3\u8853), such as sharingan, are also a subset of those.\nHow did those abilities first appear? Did they appear naturally, or were they made on purpose as a result of experiments? \n", "post_id": "305", "cluster_id": 21, "novelty": true, "order": 0}

The fact that they're able to grow their own bones seems to indicate that they are able to get the calcium (and other minerals) out of their nearby surrounding in some manner. Is this corroborated in the manga?\nThe last part is just my own speculation. Please do correct me if an alternate explanation exists.\n", "post_id": "2108", "cluster_id": 21, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
