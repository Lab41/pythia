I was reading this manga about a male protagonist who attends this school that is only for students who have spirits. And these spirits dictate whether or not the student is worthy enough to stay in this school. So the higher your rank, the better marks you receive. So the main protagonist hates going to school, and the only way to get better marks, is to fight. So when the marks were posted, he was the lowest and they were considering to expel him. So he was forced to fight and his spirit was considered one of the top best, it was a lion fighting spirit that looked like a cute doll. Also the main protagonist had a sister who keeps bugging him.\n"}
