{"body_text": "Why Can Devil Fruit Users Use Their Abilities While Wet My understanding was that the sea is supposed to weaken devil fruit users and rob them of their powers. The One Piece wiki elaborated: \nMy questions:\n\nHow did Ajoki freeze the ocean?\n\n\nMay I emphasize he submerged his hand in the sea to use Ice Age.\nHow did Luffy fight Crocodile while wet at Marine Ford?\n\n\nHe was dripping wet after having fallen into the sea. Does the water not weaken him since he was no submerged? I assumed since sea stone worked just by touching it and it has the same effect a the ocean, then by having part of the ocean \"touch\" him would drain his power.\nAre these just plot holes or am I missing something?\n", "post_id": "23344", "cluster_id": 1061, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
