{"body_text": "Why did Jiraiya have to die? In Naruto, when Jiraiya fights Pain, he goes out of the barrier to confirm his suspicion about Pain (that all the 7 pains are dead) but he could have used a shadow clone instead. Shadow clones can transfer knowledge and experience (as told by Kakashi) and if Jiraiya had the chakra to maintain the barrier, swim when he is badly injured and then be alive just to write a message on the back of the toad (apparently I forgot the toad's name), he could have had the chakra to create a shadow clone. Why didn't he do so? [Why did he have die? I feel so sad about him :'( ]\n", "post_id": "8193", "cluster_id": 284, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Why didn't Jiraiya use reverse summoning as a way to escape? We know that animals can reverse summon humans who have a contract with them. So, my question is: why didn't Fukasaku reverse summon Jiraiya to Mount Myoboku while fighting Pain? If Jiraiya had enough time to write on Fukasaku's back then a reverse summon could be performed easily in that time. This would end up giving Jiraiya intel on pain and leaving the Sannin alive.\nWhy was reverse summoning not used to save Jiraiya? Are there any limitations on the technique that prevent its usage?\n", "post_id": "8531", "cluster_id": 284, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
