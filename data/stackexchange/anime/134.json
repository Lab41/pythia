I was wondering if every mangaka (or prehaps most of them) prepares some chapter beforehand, or if they develop the plot and draw the chapter at a glance, during the week after the last one is released.\nI red this question and the answer with lowest score is very nice, but without a link is not possible to define it credible (with respect of the author).\nMaybe Shonen Jump (and other magazine) require an amount of chapters beforehand, in order to be \"safe\" in case of something happens?\n"}

I have always wondered how many of these amazing plots just unwind so naturally. Is it done as they go along or do they have separate set sessions for developing ideas, writing etc. Not to answer my question but one would have to assume the latter, I'm just asking how far ahead is said planning usually done.\nFor example, when Naruto initially started was there ever a plan to have the Akatsuki and Pain or have Jiraiya die?\n"}
