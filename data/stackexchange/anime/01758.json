{"body_text": "Why does anime air in 4 seasons per year of ~13 episodes? Most likely, the actual seasons are not a cause for the television broadcasting schedule in Japan. Furthermore, the seasons themselves don't much align to actual seasons, with \"Spring 2015\" ending in late June.\nIt seems strange to me that series air in such regular intervals and with such consistent lengths (only deviating by perhaps 2 episodes from what I've seen).\nFurthermore, I'm no expert on western television, but it seems to me that western shows don't adhere to such a rigid schedule.\nNotably, it seems that season lengths have changed in anime over the years, too. For instance, the original season of Naruto had 35 episodes, which is something I don't think would happen these days.\nIs there a specific reason for this schedule? (cultural or otherwise)\n", "post_id": "22477", "cluster_id": 1758, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Does a series in Japan only get aired if it has more than 13 episodes? while reading this answer it said in one of the quotes\nhowever i have a number of series which don't have even 20 episodes like Puella Magi Madoka Magica (12 episodes), Black Rock Shooter (Series) (8 Episodes), Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha (the original series and A's, 13 episodes each) and a number of Monogatari series have less than 10 episodes\nSo i am wondering if what the quote says is accurate and if so how does a series, like the ones i mention, get aired on TV if they aren't long enough to warrant airing on Japanese TV?\n", "post_id": "31759", "cluster_id": 1758, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
