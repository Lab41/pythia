{"body_text": "What are the reasons for producing short-form anime? Short-form anime (or tanpen anime, see Is there official terminology for anime series that run less than the standard length?) are relatively common, with at least a few each season. \nIt seems strange to me that this would be a worthwhile investment for studios. Sure, the production costs will be lower, but there are certain overheads that aren't going to scale with cost, and their DVD sales will surely be lower. So it seems like a losing deal for studios. \nWhy, from a production standpoint, would studios decide to produce short-form anime over a full-length TV series? \n", "post_id": "17239", "cluster_id": 849, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Why don't more video games get full anime adaptations? In this definition of \"video game\", I am purposely excluding visual novels. By \"video game\", I generally mean anything you can play on a console (e.g. Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy, Kingdom Hearts, Fire Emblem, etc...).\nSo most anime that airs each season is adapted from some form of source material, like a manga, a light novel, or a visual novel. Why aren't video games adapted as often? Sure, there are a few out there (Valkyria Chronicles, MapleStory, Devil May Cry, and of course Pokemon, to name a few), but overall, anime adapted from games tend to be much less frequent than those adapted from LNs or VNs. \nWhy is this? Why don't bigger title games (like the aforementioned Chrono Trigger or one of the many Final Fantasy games) get full-length anime adaptations? (I'm also not counting those small OVAs or side story series that have nothing to do with the actual in-game story either). \n", "post_id": "22559", "cluster_id": 849, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
