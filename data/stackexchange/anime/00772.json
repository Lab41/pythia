{"body_text": "Looking for manga apps which filter out mature content My son is into manga and anime. When I look for 'kid-friendly' sources for him to read and watch, I make sure that they filter out the mature stuffs. Currently, he has the Crunchy Roll app, and it seems to be pretty kid-friendly and filtered. If I am wrong, please let me know.\nHe asked me to check out an app called \"Manga Rock\", but from the first page, the results were not the kind of stuff I want him to read due to the heavily mature content. (If you know what I mean...)\nAny recommendations for a manga app that I can feel comfortable with?\n", "post_id": "20621", "cluster_id": 772, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "How can I identify child-appropriate manga? I have a 9 year old daughter that has expressed some interest in manga, but I'm having trouble locating series that are appropriate for her age. No one at our local bookstore could offer any advice. Is there a kid-friendly imprint or other resource I could use to help her find something appropriate?\nClarification: I recognize that there's a lot of personal opinion wrapped up in what is considered appropriate. What I'm really hoping for is a way to narrow down my options so that I can make a judgement for myself.\nMy preference is for physical books but I'm willing to explore digital options. I see from the potential duplicate question notification that the Crunchyroll app may be an option.\n", "post_id": "21936", "cluster_id": 772, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
