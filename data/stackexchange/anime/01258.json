{"body_text": "When does The Last: Naruto the Movie take place within Naruto Shippuden anime series and Naruto manga? I've recently binge watched all of the original Naruto series and have started on Naruto Shippuden (around episode 20 as of now). Recently, I heard that the movie The Last: Naruto the Movie came out. From what I have heard, the movie has spoilers about the end of the manga (like chapter 700), but I'm currently not reading the manga (though I plan on starting).\nIf I were to watch the movie, when does the movie take place within Naruto Shippuden, if at all? I saw somewhere saying that it took place at around episode 399-400, but I also heard that a series following Shippuden is coming, so I don't know if I should watch Shippuden, then the upcoming series, and then the movie. \n", "post_id": "20657", "cluster_id": 1258, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "When should I watch the two latest Naruto movies? I have completed watching all the currently released Naruto Shippuden episodes. I have completed the Naruto original series, and am on episode 436 of the subbed Naruto Shippuden series. My question is, when should I watch The Last: Naruto the Movie and Boruto: Naruto the Movie? Should I wait until I am completely done with the Shippuden series, or do I watch them now? \nI have seen other answers, but none have been definitive for me. I have not read any of the Manga, nor do I plan to at this point. However, I do not want these movies to spoil any of the plot lines from the Shippuden series for me. How many episodes are left in the Shippuden series? Can someone please give me some guidance and/or information on these topics? Thank you so much!\n", "post_id": "26927", "cluster_id": 1258, "novelty": false, "order": 1}
