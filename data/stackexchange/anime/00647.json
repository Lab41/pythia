I've watched the Magi anime (labyrinth and kingdom of magic) and would like to read the manga to see what comes next. My question: How close is the manga to the anime? Is it different enough that I should read the manga from the beginning or could I start off where the anime left off? And if I could start off where the anime left off, about what chapter would that be? :D\nThanks so much in advance~!\n", "post_id": "19885", "cluster_id": 647, "novelty": false, "order": 1}
