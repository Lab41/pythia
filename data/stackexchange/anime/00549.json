{"body_text": "Why do producers translate some anime titles? A lot of producers these days seem to change the original Japanese name to English alternatives. Why do they do this? Does this add any value to the name of the anime in other countries or is it just that it is easier to read for people outside of japan/otaku society?\nBecause some of the cases are really weird and in my opinion not necessary. An example of this would be \"Ace of Diamond\" also known as \"Diamond no Ace\".\nIs there anything to gain from translating the title? Also, why don't all series do this?\n", "post_id": "5426", "cluster_id": 549, "novelty": false, "order": 1}
