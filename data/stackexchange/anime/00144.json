{"body_text": "What race are the humans in Attack on Titan? What language do they speak? The majority of characters in Attack on Titan have German names. Does this mean they are Europeans? We know Mikasa Ackerman is Oriental. Did the writers avoid describing her as Asian because in the universe they have created, Asia doesn't exist? (The use of word Oriental may be a direct translation, but I'm not sure.)\nObviously the anime is in Japanese, but this surely doesn't mean the characters speak Japanese?\nAre characters in Attack on Titan (or any anime) self-aware about the language they speak, or their own race?\nHow do anime/manga creators explain race and language in their art? Is this a detail that is left out because it has no explanation, or is it an answer of \"It's just that way\"? Maybe anime are created in a fictional bubble with their own set of rules, and viewers are supposed to suspend disbelief.\nI know this maybe a silly and or odd question, but I simply can't wrap my ahead around it. \n", "post_id": "5537", "cluster_id": 144, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
