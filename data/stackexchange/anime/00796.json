{"body_text": "Why do some anime in Japanese contain English? It seems that many anime and manga aired or printed in Japanese, before they are dubbed or localized, contain English text or lyrics.\nI've tagged a couple of examples here. \nThe first is from Digimon Tamers, wherein there are a couple English lines within the otherwise Japanese title sequence:\n\nAnd another example from Neon Genesis Evangelion, where the text on the monitors is printed in English:\n\nThere are countless other examples (one I couldn't find was another scene from Tamers in which a beer can reads \"BEER\"); so, my question is: \nWhy do these English words make their way into otherwise entirely Japanese productions?\n", "post_id": "835", "cluster_id": 796, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
