As mentioned in this answer, the terms seme and uke are used in yaoi to describe a duality:\n\nYaoi fans have adapted these terms to describe the roles in a male/male relationship: the seme is the one who takes the traditional male role: initiates the relationship, \"pursues\" the uke and is usually \"on top\" during sex. This can get ridiculously codified and outright heteronormative, e.g. the seme has to be taller and stronger, not show their emotions, etc. The \"uke ends up winning\" aspect may or may not be relevant.\n\nIf there is an equivalent to this kind of relationship in yuri manga and animation, what is it called?\n"}
