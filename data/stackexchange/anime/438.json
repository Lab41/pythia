I've never seen a manga with so many full color chapters.

Yet from chapter 116 to 134 (as of today on mangahere) all of the chapters have a .1 version that has full colors. From my perspective, this is very unusual. I understand that it is a very popular manga, but manga I listed above and other manga are just or even more popular but none to my knowledge have had this many strings of full-colored publications. Is there a reason to this or did the author/artist just have a lot of extra time to devote to coloring in the manga?\n"}
