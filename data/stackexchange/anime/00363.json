According to MAL, the former is the parent story of the latter, that appears described as a side story.

{"body_text": "Watching order for \"Toaru Majutsu no Index\" and related anime I am slowly coming to the end of watching \"Toaru Majutsu no Index\" anime. There are a few anime series related to that world:\n\nToaru Majutsu no Index\nToaru Majutsu no Index II\nToaru Kagaku no Railgun\nToaru Kagaku no Railgun S\n\nand some movies. But I am not sure in what order I should watch them. Someone told me that \"Railgun\" came after \"Majutsu no Index\" - should I watch \"Railgun\" first then, or the second season of \"Index\"? Are there some things that I can miss if I watch them in the wrong order, like not knowing characters that were already introduced? \nAnd if it is Railgun I should watch second, should I watch \"Toaru Majutsu no Index II\" afterwards, or \"Toaru Kagaku no Railgun S\"?\nOr is it that it really doesn't matter and I can watch both of the \"Toaru Majutsu no Index\" series before the two \"Toaru Kagaku no Railgun\" series?\n", "post_id": "11673", "cluster_id": 363, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
