{"body_text": "Does Devil's Fruit power gained depend on how much of it is eaten? Luffy accidentally ate the Gomu-Gomu (Rubber-Rubber) fruit, but was interrupted by Shanks after a few bites. It was too late and Luffy got the Devil's Fruit powers anyway. If he had instead eaten the whole of it, would he have got even more power from the fruit? \n", "post_id": "906", "cluster_id": 22, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Does the size of a person matter when Devil Fruit powers are involved? As seen in the anime, Lily Enstomach grew herself into the size of a giant inside Luffy thus giving Luffy immense power.  He was strong with a weakness of becoming slower.  However, when he went into 2nd gear, the sheer power of turning into 2nd gear caused everything around him to be thrown back.\nSo does the size determine the amount of initial power the person has?\n-The reason why I said initial was because power really matters on the training rather than the power of the devil fruit\nExample:\nLuffy, when he got bigger, the effect of 2nd Gear was stronger.\nLet's say that Buggy's devil fruit (section-section) gives Buggy the ability to split and fly a range 25 meters around his feet.  If Buggy was the size of a giant or the size of Whitebeard, would the range increase?\nThis is not about how much the devil fruit is eaten.\n", "post_id": "2214", "cluster_id": 22, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
