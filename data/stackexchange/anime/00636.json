{"body_text": "Why did Kurama keep helping Naruto? As I was browsing through an old question, the answer shocked me. It seems that if Naruto were killed, Kurama would just revive. Then why did Kurama give Naruto some of its chakra when he was on the verge of death? For instance, when Naruto first summoned Gamabunta while falling to his potential death, Kurama gave him some chakra and helped him out. Wasn't Kurama's dream to break free from Naruto? What's the need of breaking the seal when he can just let Naruto die and he is free? He did push Naruto to the point of opening the gate when Naruto fought with Pain. Why not just sit tight and let Naruto die? Did I miss something? All this while I thought if the host dies so does the tailed beast.\n", "post_id": "18946", "cluster_id": 636, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Why aren't Kyuubi and Naruto real allies? Several characters in the Naruto universe share their bodies with other entities, most of them are true allies. They share the Power both have, even if one has the upper hand controlling the body.\nMy question is, why doesn't this happen with Kyuubi and Naruto?\nSeveral times Kyuubi saves Naruto with his red chakra out of hairy situations. Naruto is aware of it and sometimes they talk to each other.\nKyuubi is an evil Daemon, sure, but due to the fact tat he would die if Naruto died; and Naruto, as a Ninja, has a dangerous live; it would be in Kyuubi's advantage to help out, given that his Chakra is way stronger than Naruto's.\nWhy don't they team up?\nEDIT: Question regarding Naruto Vanilla not Shipuuden or anything else.\n", "post_id": "19515", "cluster_id": 636, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
