{"body_text": "Does the \"bloody nose\" trope necessarily imply a sexual situation? If you've seen much anime, you're familiar with the male character getting a bloody nose when he gets sexually excited. For example:\n\n\nMaster Roshi (Dragon Ball) and Umino Iruka (Naruto)\nHowever, when I mentioned this to a Japanese person (someone who was not a big anime viewer), she was confused, and adamant that a bloody nose would normally just mean that the person was excited in general, and it would not necessarily have anything to do with sexual excitement.\nThis could (and seems likely to be) true for Japanese day to day real life, but very different in anime, where the connection to libido seems very clear.  \nIs there someone that can explain this difference? Is the \"bloody nose\" in anime just used to signify excitement, and it just happens to often (always) be sexual excitement because of the plot? Or is it supposed to be just understood how a bloody nose is interpreted in anime is different from normal life?\n", "post_id": "39", "cluster_id": 838, "novelty": true, "order": 0}

In some animes that I have seen men are shown to have nose-bleeds when they see a naked woman.\nIs there a cultural reason behind this? Or is it just shown in animes?\n", "post_id": "22466", "cluster_id": 838, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
