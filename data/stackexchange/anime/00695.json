I just watched the third movie (Puella Magi Madoka Magica the Movie Part 3: Rebellion) and I have a doubt about the fact that although Madoka wish in the second movie, which prevented the birth of any witch, both in the past and in the future. Why then Homura becomes a Witch?\nI get an idea, but I'm not pretty sure about it. In the ending we see Homura feeding QB with her soul gem. Does this mean that all the curses of the universe are now contained in Homura's soul gem? And that feeding QB with them is a way to stop entropy?\nWhen Homura says to Sayaka and Madoka that one day they will be enemies, is she referring to the fact that without suffering sooner or later the universe will run out of energy and Madoka and Sayaka will have to stop her?\n", "post_id": "5926", "cluster_id": 695, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "What exactly happens to Kyuubei at the end of Rebellion? Note: this topic was somewhat addressed in this question, but remained unclear to me after reading the answers to it.\nAt the end of Rebellion, after Homura has rebelled and created the Homuverse where everyone can have their desires for love and friendship fulfilled, after the end credits, we see Homura in a field, holding her new soul gem and dancing around a mangy, scruffy, miserable-looking Kyuubei.\n\n\n\nAs the movie ends, the camera closes in on Kyuubei's face, and we see its eyes seem to be ringed with the same black field as the witches' curses.\n\n\nWhat exactly is going on here? It seems clear that Homura is torturing Kyuubei for its many crimes, but what exactly is she doing?\n", "post_id": "21024", "cluster_id": 695, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
