But, when I search for it, I only get 2 episodes from their screening room. When I search eBay, I only get Japanese imports and nothing from the United States or the UK.\nHas Guilty Crown been released at all on DVD, or is it only available through streaming?\n", "post_id": "3727", "cluster_id": 79, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Where I can buy/rent digital versions of Studio Ghibli films? To be honest, I\u2019m mostly interested in Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s films (My Neighbor Totoro, Princess Mononoke, Ponyo). They aren\u2019t available on Netflix, iTunes, the PS3 or Xbox VOD services despite other Disney-owned movies (Pixar movies for example) being available there. Has Disney ever put any of Ghibli's films in any digital distribution service?\n", "post_id": "3982", "cluster_id": 79, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
