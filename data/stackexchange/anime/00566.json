They do seem to become less active at night or if deprived of sunlight, and so it may be possible they draw their primary source of energy from the sun. Annie refused to go underground. There also seems to be types of wall titans.\nIt seems to me that titans are scared of underground and need of sunlight make them weak to underground.
