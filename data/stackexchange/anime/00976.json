{"body_text": "What is the purpose of characters shouting out the name of their attack? It seems to me that in a lot of anime (Naruto, Dragon Ball, Gurren Lagann, and Digimon are four that come to mind), characters or creatures who perform an attack tend to shout its name, almost as if necessary to perform such an attack. This seems very counterintuitive\u2014telling your opponent that you're about to use a fireball would open you up to being blocked very easily.\n\nWhy do anime characters tend to shout the names of their attacks?

{"body_text": "Why do Japanese anime characters shout so much? I would like to point out this incident from NHK ni Youkoso - Episode 21 (11:12 to 11:34).\nThe main character Sato is escorting his friend Yamazaki to a subway station to bid final adieu to him. Yamazaki is a game creator (gal games) and MC helps him to create one. I have written below a short piece of dialogue (writing it from the English subtitles) between the two at the subway station:\nNow my question to all the fellow members is, why does the character shout here? It seems a bit awkwardly and reluctantly placed. This is one instance which I have cited here but I have seen this sort of thing in other animes before. I can't exactly remember the names.\n", "post_id": "23661", "cluster_id": 976, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
