{"body_text": "When and why did the trend of 1:30-long openings and endings begin? I've started to notice lately that the vast majority of anime (that I can find, anyway) seems to have opening (OP) and ending (ED) sequences which are 1 minute and 30 seconds long.\nSome examples (though I'm sure there are lots that I haven't covered):\n\nFullmetal Alchemist: There are 5 OPs and 5 EDs, all of which are 1:30 long.\nDigimon Tamers, Steins;Gate: Both OP and ED are 1:30.\nGaoGaiGar and Neon Genesis Evangelion: The OPs are 1:30 long, though the EDs are only 1:00 in duration.\nCardcaptor Sakura: The OPs are 1:30, did not check the ED durations.\n\nThere do seem to be some exceptions (again, far from an exhaustive list):\n\nOne Piece: Though some episodes fit this pattern, others have 3-minute OPs and no EDs. (The combined duration is still the same, though.)\nAkagi, Kaiji: OP is shorter than 1 minute.\nGa-rei: Zero, Aria: During the OP or ED music (which is 1:30 long), things unrelated to the OP/ED sequence happen (like actual parts of the episodes).\n\nThese lists are just examples of each, and don't really show that the vast majority of anime (I would wager 90% or higher) seem to follow the 1:30 OP/ED \"rule\".\nIt is worth noting that most American series have openings which are 30 seconds or 1 minute in length; Family Guy and the Sonic the Hedgehog cartoon are examples of this, though there are far more.\nWhen did the 1 minute 30 second duration of OPs and EDs start to come into popularity, and is there a particular reason why they did so?\n", "post_id": "2597", "cluster_id": 562, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "What are the reasons for producing short-form anime? Short-form anime (or tanpen anime, see Is there official terminology for anime series that run less than the standard length?) are relatively common, with at least a few each season. \nIt seems strange to me that this would be a worthwhile investment for studios. Sure, the production costs will be lower, but there are certain overheads that aren't going to scale with cost, and their DVD sales will surely be lower. So it seems like a losing deal for studios. \nWhy, from a production standpoint, would studios decide to produce short-form anime over a full-length TV series? \n", "post_id": "17239", "cluster_id": 562, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
