{"body_text": "What is the paper at Saki's desk in From the New World about? I've been wondering this for ages:\nAt the end of From the New World, Saki has this piece of paper on her desk. Below you can see it (and somebody translated them to Spanish).\nApparently these are names, and some of them are followed by a number. Unfortunately I don't recognise any of those names so I'm not sure what is this paper about.\nAt first I guessed it was some sort of deceased people list (numbers representing their age?). However the fourth name reads \"New Yuubari\", so it sounds like a place rather than somebody... but it lacks a number, so it could actually be a headline, as in \"the following people died at New Yuubari\" - same thing for \"Shinamoto\", which makes sense - but then the first three names lack a headline.\nSo I'm not sure - what is this paper?\n\n", "post_id": "9239", "cluster_id": 1233, "novelty": true, "order": 0}

According to this answer it appears that each of the districts are in each of Japan's Regions\nTomiko, who lives in Kamisu 66 is the head of the Ethics Committee and she wanted Saki, who also lived in Kamisu 66, to take her place one day.\nI am wondering if the Ethics Committee's Tomiko is the head of control of all of Japan, or if each region/district has their own Ethics Committee. If the latter, do they all share the same ruleset (particularly regarding the age a child can be terminated being changed to 17 years)?\n", "post_id": "26719", "cluster_id": 1233, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
