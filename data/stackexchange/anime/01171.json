{"body_text": "Why wasn't there an OP for Shinobu Time? Each of the arcs of the Monogatari series through the end of Second Season (Hitagi Crab, Mayoi Snail, ..., Hitagi End) has had an OP theme sung by the arc's heroine1, save for Shinobu Time (i.e. Onimonogatari), which did not have an OP theme at all.\nWhat gives? Shinobu's voice actress is Maaya Sakamoto, who is probably the most talented singer out of the entire Monogatari cast! Why didn't she sing an OP for Shinobu's arc?\n\n1 Well, the OP for Hitagi End (Koimonogatari) was sung by both Kaiki and Senjougahara, but I think we can agree that they were both the heroines of that arc.\n", "post_id": "8549", "cluster_id": 1171, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
