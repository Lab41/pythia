I can't remember the names of the characters. These are what I can remember:\n\nIt is about a school which only accepts students who can see an island in the sky.\nOn the first day, everyone was given a word which turned out to be some kind of power. The main character got the word which allowed him to change his appearance to that of other people.\nMost of the student were killed in the first day by some kind of monster, and there were monsters appearing everyday (except for rainy days).\nThere was one student who got the word which made him immortal. Another one got the word which gave him the ability to steal anything (heart, brain, etc.)\n\n"}
