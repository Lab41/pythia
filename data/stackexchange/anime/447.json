He also is tended by a young, blonde and kind maid whom he also taught to write or something.\nThe ruler of that world is interested in the main character. The ruler is a very young stubborn and spoiled girl, who gets her way, and who likes manga.\nAny suggestions?\n"}

He is then drugged and brought to fantasy world with elves dragons and such. The ruler likes the culture of otaku so he tells him to teach the people about anime and stuff. Also the military try to get ahold of the world. I'm sorry that is all I could remember. I will understand if no one knows what it is ^^\nThanks\nKirre~\n"}
