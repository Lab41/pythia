{"body_text": "How can Boruto handle a Ch\u014d\u014ddama Rasengan? We see that at the end of Boruto:Naruto the Movie,\n\n Boruto defeats the enemy by hitting him with what it seems a Ch\u014d\u014ddama Rasengan (IMHO it looks larger than a Ch\u014d\u014ddama Rasengan). I think Naruto infused some of his chakra in Boruto's jutsu to make it that big.\n\nWe see it took time for Jiraiya and Naruto to master the Rasengan, and Naruto was actually the only one to take it to the next level by adding his wind chakra (at the time).\nSo how can Boruto handle this large amount of chakra? Yes everyone says that Boruto can easily beat Naruto if you compare them at the same genin stage of their lives, but that doesn't mean Boruto is trained to manipulate such an insane amount of chakra. How was he able to pull it off?\n", "post_id": "30085", "cluster_id": 1691, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "How Vanishing Rasengan works? It is a miniature Rasengan which was originally developed by Boruto as seen in Boruto: Naruto the movie. In that movie when Boruto was trying to learn Rasengan in front of Sasuke then it was observed that his Rasengan usually vanishes in air but then the effect of Rasengan is still there.\nSo my question is that how Boruto was able to vanish the Rasengan? Or How Vanishing Rasengan works?\n", "post_id": "30385", "cluster_id": 1691, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
