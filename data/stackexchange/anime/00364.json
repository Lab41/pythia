It seems that many anime and manga aired or printed in Japanese, before they are dubbed or localized, contain English text or lyrics.\nI've tagged a couple of examples here. \nThe first is from Digimon Tamers, wherein there are a couple English lines within the otherwise Japanese title sequence:\n\nAnd another example from Neon Genesis Evangelion, where the text on the monitors is printed in English:\n\nThere are countless other examples (one I couldn't find was another scene from Tamers in which a beer can reads \"BEER\"); so, my question is: \nWhy do these English words make their way into otherwise entirely Japanese productions?\n", "post_id": "835", "cluster_id": 364, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
