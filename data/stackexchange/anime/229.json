In the Rules of the Death Note (i can't remember exactly which rule) and said by Ryuk himself when he was explaining things to Light ealry in the series, the main difference between a Human using the Death Note and a Shinigami using the Death Note is that Humans don't gain the difference in lifespan when they take a life while Shinigami do.\nNow considering all the people the Kiras took the life of, they all could have been potential targets for Shinigami to increase their life.\nSo i am wondering, what exactly happens to the lifespan that normally would collected by a Shinigami when a Human uses the Death Note?\n"}

Since a shinigami dies when he saves a human with his death note, he dies. But when a human does it, he/she won't die. This makes me wondering what happens when a human saves another human with a death note. So here's my bad example:\nMr. X is a serial killer. \nHe sees a young Lady and decides to kill her. He stalks her, to know her better.\nOne week later, the boyfriend from the lady gets a death note from a shinigami. \nOn the next day, Mr. X tries to kill the lady but her boyfriend writes Mr. Xs name in his death note. Will the young Lady now get a new lifespan. Or will she get the lifespan from Mr. X? \n(Just an example) \n"}
