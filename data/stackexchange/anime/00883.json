{"body_text": "Is there a huge difference in the amount of male vs. female protagonists in anime and manga? I'm wondering if there's an imbalance in Japanese society as there is in American society. Or if anyone has come across a survey that found the percent of female vs. male protagonists in anime and manga?\nI think the main difference in anime and manga is that the Japanese have created genres to meet the interests of those who consume anime and manga (which if I'm not mistaken, is a far larger amount than Americans who consume comics and cartoons). For boys, they have shounen, and for girls, shoujo. For more matured tastes we have seinen and josei (which could arguably still be divided into men and women). In shounen, the protagonist is predominantly male, and in shoujo, the protagonist is usually female. Should I instead be looking at which genre is produced more for my answer?\n", "post_id": "15088", "cluster_id": 883, "novelty": true, "order": 0}
{"body_text": "Is the term Otaku derogatory? I know the term is widely used in America as a term for someone who has a love and anime and all things related to it. So in the US it's a term of endearment. \nHowever in Japan the term is known more or less to be used to describe a shut-in / loner. But it actually originated from a few variations. One being the name of a stalker / murderer another just meaning someone with a love for Japanese culture. \nSo is the term really bad, good or more or less up to the individual to find a meaning?   \n", "post_id": "3410", "cluster_id": 883, "novelty": true, "order": 1}
