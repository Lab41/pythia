* [cluster_schema.json](cluster_schema.json) -- Schematized form for one record in a JSON file describing input to Pythia
* [stackexchange/anime](stackexchange/anime) -- A slice of data from the Stack Exchange data dump (https://archive.org/details/stackexchange, released under CC BY-SA 3.0), suitable for quick experimentation.
