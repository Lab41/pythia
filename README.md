## Novelty detection in text corpora

Pythia is Lab41's exploration of approaches to novel content detection. We are interested in making it easier to tell when a document coming into a corpus has something new to say.
We welcome your contributions (please see contributor guidelines in CONTRIBUTING) and attention.

The first demos of Pythia at work can be found in [src/pipelines](src/pipelines). We will work hard to keep these usable and up-to-date as we move forward.
