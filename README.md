## Novelty detection in text corpora

Pythia is Lab41's exploration of approaches to novel content detection. We are interested in making it easier to tell when a document coming into a corpus has something new to say.
We welcome your contributions (please see contributor guidelines in CONTRIBUTING) and attention.

We are still getting started on our codebase, so there is not much to see yet. We encourage you to explore the work available in `disc_conc/`, which addresses an interesting, related text classification problem.
