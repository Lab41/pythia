(KT, 030200.SE) apologized Sunday after acknowledging that the personal data for 8.7 million of the company's subscribers had been hacked and said it will devote efforts to prevent any recurrences. Earlier in the day, media reports said the police have arrested hackers who are suspected of having stolen personal data of the customers of the nation's second-largest mobile operator. KT had requested a police investigation on July 13 after detecting signs of possible hacking through internal monitoring, the company said in a statement. The company has has since retrieved all the personal data that had been allegedly collected by the hackers, it added.\",\n",
