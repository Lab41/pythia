    "This notebook walks you through training a skip-thoughts model. It was used with semi-success to train a skip-thoughts model on a gpu-backed machine with the Pythia kernel against the entire stackexchange corpus. It was prepared over the course of 8 days, and isn't perfect.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first section will require the user to make several data paths.\n",

    "\n",
    "There is some trickiness about what a skip-thought model is. The model provided by the skip-thoughts paper was actually trained 3 times, once on its corpus, then again on its corpus with half as many dimensions, then again on its corpus with reversed-order sentences, again with half-as many dimensions. They then concatenate the results.\n",

    "We don't attempt this. We merely train a single  \"uni-skip\" model.\n",

    "The encode function found in the file skipthoughts.py insists on two models, uni-skip and bi-skip. To encode off a single uni-skip module, the encode function found in the tools.py file is needed. It unfortunately tends to die and die badly when I use it.\n",
