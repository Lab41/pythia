#This code provides a piecewise hashing of documents with variables to set the window_size for each piece, whether to split on words or characters, whether to provide sliding, and how big the sliding_window should be.

#Functions

#hashDocument:
	#Parameters:
		#text: text of document to be hashed
		#window_size: default of 25; number of characters or words to hash at a time
		#words: default of False; hash by characters = False; hash by words = True
		#sliding: default of True; slide the window and overlap the hashes or have no overlap
		#sliding_window: default of 4; ignored if sliding = False; must be less than the size of window_size
	#Description: Hashes a text document using a window_size to hash piecewise. Provide string of text document and string of piecewise hash for that text document will be returned.

#splitText:
	#Parameters:
		#text: text of document to be hashed
		#window_size: default of 25; number of characters or words to hash at a time
		#words: default of False; hash by characters = False; hash by words = True
		#sliding: default of True; slide the window and overlap the hashes or have no overlap
		#sliding_window: default of 4; ignored if sliding = False; must be less than the size of window_size
	#Description: Splits the text into the sizes needed for hashing. Returns a list of strings split based on the parameters provided
