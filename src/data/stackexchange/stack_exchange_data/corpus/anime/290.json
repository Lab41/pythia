I was browsing on the internet looking for some legal sites that allow free or paid streaming of animes that are not subbed, are still in Japanese and are not dubbed. However, I can't seem to find any legal sites where I can actually find just the original animes that haven't been hard subbed.\nIs there a list of legal websites that allow legal streaming of the animes without it being subbed or dubbed? \n"}

I want to know which websites out there provide legal streaming services for dubbed anime.
