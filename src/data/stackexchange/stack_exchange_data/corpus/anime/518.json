In the Pokemon game, specifically in the older version Red and Green, there are some news (or rumors) that the tone used in the Lavender Town caused a syndrome (called Lavender Town Syndrome) where kids who played it and heard the tone get sick and worst, eventually committed suicide. Coincidentally (or maybe not), you can find the Pokemon Tower in the Lavender Town, where you can hunt ghost Pokemon. How true is this and does it have any relevance to the anime Pokemon or was it ever mentioned on the anime itself? \n"}
