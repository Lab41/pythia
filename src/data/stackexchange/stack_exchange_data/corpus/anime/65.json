We could see plenty of times in both Fullmetal Alchemist anime series (at least twice in the 2003 series and at least once in the 2009 series, according to my memories) that connecting the automails seriously hurts for Ed. What's the reason?\nMy theory is that during connecting, it \"turns on\" and sends an electric wave to the brain to provide right functionality.\n"}

An automail must be a masterpiece, as the user seems to be able to use it as a fully working arm/leg/... It seems however, that it's no regular artificial limb.\nWhat's so special about an automail? How does it work? Are there any drawbacks?\n"}
