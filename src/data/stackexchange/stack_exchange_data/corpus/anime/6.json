He then unsummoned Deidara and has never summoned him since then. Edo Tensei makes Deidara immortal, which allows Deidara to use the C0, a giant explosion that covers an area of 10 km diameter, several times. Kabuto could have used this to eliminate the enemy units more effectively, but why did he not do so?\n\n"}

This question contains spoilers for anime viewers and early manga readers.\nWe've seen Nagato use his Rinnegan to the fullest, using the Rikudo technique (to control 6 bodies)\n\n As well as by fighting alone, as a reincarnated zombie.\n\nHe utilized all 6 paths of the Rinnegan.\n\n\n So why don't Obito and Madara? Madara only used the Preta Path, to absorb incoming ninjutsu. Obito only tried to use the Human Path, to try and kill Naruto.\n\nWhy don't they use any other realms? Their Rinnegan is supposedly perfect. I can't imagine they're holding back on purpose, the Rinnegan has some pretty scary abilities.\n"}
