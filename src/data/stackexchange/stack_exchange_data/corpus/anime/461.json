From my understanding, Suigintou's color scheme is black (2013 anime) or purple (2004 anime) while Mercury as the metal is silver, while I don't think the planet is black or purple. Nor do I get how Lamp fits.\nSo how does Suigintou's title match with her?\n"}

Each of the Rozen Maiden Dolls has an artificial spirit. Since there is so much in this series that has a deeper meaning of some sort (episode titles and doll names jump to mind) I\u2019m assuming that their names will also have a deeper meaning \u2014 especially since there are names such as Pizzicato (Kanaria\u2019s artificial spirit) that are clearly not Japanese at all.\nThe only one that partially makes sense to me though, is Berrybell, Hina-Ichigo\u2019s artificial spirit which fits into the general word-cloud strawberry. What significance is behind the names of the other dolls\u2019 artificial spirits?\n"}
