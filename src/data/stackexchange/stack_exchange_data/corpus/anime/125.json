All of Cowboy Bebop's soundtrack was composed and performed by them.\nLooking at their discography, their albums are all from the Cowboy Bebop franchise, except their live DVD. However, I am unsure as to whether they were created for this purpose, or if they were just a perfect fit.\nAre there any bands that dedicate themselves specifically to composing and performing for anime? Or that may be created specifically for a certain series/franchise? \n"}
