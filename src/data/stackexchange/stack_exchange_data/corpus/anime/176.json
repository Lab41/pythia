The anime series Ghost in the Shell has a Japanese name which can be transliterated as \"Mobile Armored Riot Police\"; from Wikipedia:\n\nGhost in the Shell (\u653b\u6bbb\u6a5f\u52d5\u968a K\u014dkaku Kid\u014dtai?, literally \"Mobile Armored Riot Police\")\n\nIt's clear to me that the English name of \"Ghost in the Shell\" is far, well, cooler than \"Mobile Armored Riot Police\". But why was this particular name chosen? What are its origins, and what significance does it have in the series (if any)?\n"}
