I'm pretty sure it was a one-shot manga, and I think it was part of a collection of four different one-shot manga. Their general themes were all to do with high school romance.\nIt's about this girl who likes the school president or someone similar. He's a smart looking kid with glasses and all. She finally goes to confess to him but ends up confessing to the wrong guy, who is like a delinquent. He's mean to her and everything but as time passes on, the girl finds herself starting to fall for that mean guy whom she accidentally confessed to.\nThen one day she's looking at a picture of that school president whom she was supposed to confess to and starts tearing up for some reason. Then the mean guy who is now her \"boyfriend\" comes up and she rushes out, embarrassed (because she was crying). She drops the picture and the mean guy picks it up and realizes what happened. He says something like \"Don't confess to the wrong person next time\" and breaks up with her. Unfortunately, the girl was already in love with that mean guy.\nP.S.: It is not the manga 'Sukitte Iccha XX Nan Desu!'. Thank you.\n"}
