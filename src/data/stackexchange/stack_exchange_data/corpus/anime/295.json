Waking up in the hospital after an accident, the boy finds that his eyes become able to see certain people's shadows. Later, it is revealed that those people are murderers, and he gets scouted and recruited by a team of 3 girls to hunt those murderers.\nSome examples of murderers:\n\nA woman with a giant eyeball shadow replacing her face. She takes eyeballs off her victims.\nA man with a scythe-shaped shadow replacing his head. He was shown eating ramen next to his victims' corpses.\n\nThe manga doesn't have an anime, I believe, since it is quite recent. I am quite certain that it was released after 2013. Not a lot of chapters are out. The premise does sound quite a lot like Shinrei Tantei Yakumo or Tsukihime.\n"}
