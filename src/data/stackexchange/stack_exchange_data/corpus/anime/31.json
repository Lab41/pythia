In both the anime and manga Naruto often ends his sentences with either \"dattebayo\" or \"believe it\" in the English translations. \nWhy is this a thing?\nIs it meant to further his character or provide a bit of remembrance of his character to the reader or viewer, or even other characters of the series?\n"}

In Naruto, at least in the early show, he uses the catchphrase \"dattebayo\" in the Japanese. This question answered on a canon-level where it came from (his mother), but I was wondering where (if anywhere) it came from in terms of the language. I know that there's no direct translation, but is it a sort of portmanteau or version of somebody's name or of some phrase in Japanese?\n"}

Throughout the series Kenshin has added 'oro' somewhat comedically to his sentences. Is there any actual meaning to this or is this just a speech style/pattern that he has?\nIn episode 62 he says it several times in a row and Kaoru points this out.\n\n"}

Using ~-san, ~-kun, ~-sama while addressing other people is common in Japanese culture.But Law uses ya as suffix while addressing people, like in the nicknames Strawhat-ya for Luffy and Blackleg-ya for Sanji, and in real names Zoro-ya, Nami-ya and Nico-ya.\nYa are translated as Mr. or Miss. in English. But in Japanese adding ya defines someone's profession. It is not that Law does not use ~-san at all, Like with Corazon and sarcastically with Vergo. As stated in this page.\nSo why does Law use ya rather then ~-san, ~-kun, etc. while addressing others?\n"}

And a lot more examples here.\nWhat is the significance of anime characters' catch phrases? \n"}
