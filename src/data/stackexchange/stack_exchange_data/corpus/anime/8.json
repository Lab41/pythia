What are their and their relatives' ages? This question is regarding One Piece.  \nI have three questions to ask. Since they are interrelated, I'm asking them as a single question on this site.\n\nAs I was reading about the prominent people in the One Piece universe, I came across Roger's page. It has been mentioned there and in many other places that Luffy is quite similar to Roger in character. Theories on some forums have gone so far as to state that Luffy is Roger's reincarnation. So, \n1. Could anyone list ALL the similarities between Roger and Luffy? \nThis question might seem too broad and ambiguous, but when I say similarity, what I'm mostly referring to is\n\nA common something that the two share\nAn instance where Luffy says or does something that reminds someone of Roger\nParallel life events\n\nI came across this video and this link that cover a few of them. I'll post the relevant ones here.\n\nA common something that the two share:\n\nWill of D \nGol D. Roger\nMonkey D. Luffy\nThe Straw Hat \n\nIn the manga and anime One Piece, Monkey D. Luffy's straw hat is the\n  main symbol of the entire series and is the origin of his nickname\n  \"Straw Hat Luffy.\"    \nMuch later, during the Straw Hat Pirates' departure for Fishman\n  Island, it was revealed by Silvers Rayleigh that this straw hat\n  originally belonged to Gol D. Roger. \n\nBoth can hear Sea Kings\n\nBesides the Mermaid of legend, the only other people who seem to be\n  able to hear the Sea King have been Monkey D. Luffy and Gol D. Roger.\n  The latter was said to be able to \"hear the voice of all things\".\n\nBoth their first mates have a scar over one eye\nThis is probably pure coincidence, or not.  \nSilvers Rayleigh\nRoronoa Zoro \nBoth are from East Blue(?)\n\nLoguetown, the city in the East Blue located closest to the Grand\n  Line, was the birthplace of the late Pirate King, Gol D. Roger.\nDawn Island: home island of Monkey D. Luffy, where he was raised in\n  the peaceful Foosha Village and where he trained on Mt. Colubo.\n\nIt is mentioned that Dawn Island is Luffy's home island, but is it mentioned anywhere that he was born there?\nThe Supernova title(?)\nLuffy is a Super Rookie, but was Roger one?\nIn the video link above, Brook says\n\nGold Roger? There might have been a rookie by that name, or maybe\n  there wasn't...\n\nIs there any solid proof that Roger was a rookie?\n\nInstances where Luffy says or does something that reminds someone of Roger:\n\nLuffy's smile when Buggy tries to execute him reminds Smoker of Roger\n\nSmoker saw the smile Luffy gave off to mirror that of Gol D. Roger's\n  twenty-two years ago, and considered Luffy to be a potential danger to\n  the world.\n\nLuffy's answer to Rayleigh when he's asked how he intends to conquer the Grand Line\n\nLuffy replied that he does not really intend to conquer it, but that\n  the person with the most freedom in the ocean would be the Pirate\n  King. This brought a smile to Rayleigh's and Shakky's faces, seeing\n  the unmistakable likeness to Roger in Luffy just as Shanks saw.\n\nLuffy's words to Raoul that he will be the next Pirate King\n\nHe was deeply shocked at hearing Luffy saying he will be the next\n  Pirate King and noted that the young boy was similar to Roger in his\n  presence.\n\n\nParallel life events:\n\nThe first person that Roger and Luffy ask to join them on their journey refuses to do so, but eventually accept the offer. Coincidentally, that person also become their crew's first mate.\nRayleigh:\n\nAt first Rayleigh declined, but some time later, he formed a bond with\n  Roger and became his first mate.  \n\nZoro:\n\nLuffy asked Zoro to join him but he flatly refused to become a pirate. Refusing to die, Zoro accepted Luffy's invitation and revealed his unique fighting style.\n\n\n\nCould anyone list other similarities and when doing so, state where the similarity is mentioned: manga, anime or both? Also, could you prove or disprove the East Blue and Supernova cases? \n\nThe similarities could just mean that the two are extremely like-minded individuals or it could mean that they are related.\nWhile in prison, Roger asks Garp to take care of his unborn son, Ace. From this, it is obvious that there's a strong bond between the two. Is the relationship based only on deep trust or are the Gol and Monkey families related? Basically,\n2. Is Roger related by blood to Garp, and in turn, to Luffy?\nA search on the web doesn't yield much, but from threads like this, this and this, a few likely possibilities(barring all supernatural theories) are:\n\nRoger is Garp's brother or brother-in-law.\nRoger is Garp's son or son-in-law.\n\nIf the relationship had been revealed explicitly, Wikipedia and Wikia would have the answer. Since it's not, has it ever been implied indirectly, anywhere in the manga/anime that Roger and Luffy are blood relatives?\n\nSince the answer to the above question might possibly be 'no' (at least for the time being), the ages of the people involved will be helpful pointers to accord with or negate theories about how Roger and Luffy could be related, to form one's own theories, or to refute the very idea that they are related. As of now, only Luffy's and Ace's ages are known, which leads to my third question,\n3. What are Garp's, Roger's, Rouge's and Dragon's ages?\nAs with the second question, there's no answer in any online encyclopedia. \nBut some statements found on the Wikia pages are:\n\n\nThirty years ago, he* fought Chinjao and earned his hatred after denting his pointy head and robbing him of the means to acquire\n  a certain treasure.\nIt would seem that he** had been around for some time, considering that Brook refers to him as a rookie, more than 50 years\n  before the current storyline.\nTwelve years before the current storyline, Dragon returned to his home in the Goa Kingdom and witnessed the burning of the Gray\n  Terminal.\n\n\n*Garp\n**Roger  \nHave there been other time related statements in the manga/anime in relation to these four people that could be used to make a rough estimate of their ages? \n\nMy apologies regarding the lengthy question.I put in all the facts that I know so that if anyone answers this question, the things I already know will be skipped. A hardcore One Piece fan will probably be able to answer. Also, my knowledge about the series is mostly limited to the Wikia and Wikipedia pages.\n"}
