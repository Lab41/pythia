I believe almost all of the people watching anime or reading manga get them from various sites like watchop.com, Crunchyroll, anime44, etc., and similarly for manga there are various sites. But are these episodes/chapters really free of cost for the audience? I know that these companies have their major source of income from merchandise and all other stuff but the episodes/chapters are available on net so easily that too for free. Aren't there any copyright violations? If there are why don't these anime/manga companies do something about it? \n"}
