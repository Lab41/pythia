I was reviewing my question about how the killer got on the roof and it suddenly struck me how weird the scene I posted in that question was. \nHere it is again for reference:\n\nIn this scene, we see Yamane introducing Miki to her own aunt. We later find out that Miki was actually Dr. Magata. Did Dr. Magata really have a sister, or not? I ask because I find that it's weird that the Aunt would not know her niece, or at least know if her brother/sister had children. It also seems weird that they would not have met. I remember that while Dr. Magata was acting as Miki she told Professor Saikawa that she was raised in America, away from Dr. Magata. However, even that sounds strange as Dr. Magata's parents were not separated.\nOn the other hand, it seems ever more odd if she didn't have a sister, because that would mean the aunt should have known right away that Miki was an imposter.\n"}

In the time that Red Magic was down, directly after her door was opened, I'm assuming Dr. Magata was able to get on to the roof without leaving any trace of her access to the doors and elevators, since the system was temporarily switched over to UNIX. However, we see her come back in with Nishinosono and the others from the roof. How does she get back on the roof without leaving any logs, in order to kill the director?\n\n"}
