In the first episode, there's a motorcyclist called Shibuimaru Takuo - Light's second victim. In the scene where he is about to kill him, according to my subtitles, he writes:\n\nShibuimaru Takuo: car accident\n\nAnd we see this:\n\nI don't know Japanese, but it seems to me that all the lines are the same, except for the two last ones.\nSince that guy is just his second victim, what exactly happened in that scene? What do these lines say, and why did Light several of them, over and over?\n"}

I dont know Japanese script, but Light would be spelled \"Tsuki\" for moon. So which of \"Tsuki\" or \"Raito\" can kill him? Would \"Light\" in English work?\nSeems the death note is a stickler for spelling as shown here: What did Light write before killing Shibuimaru Takuo?\n"}
