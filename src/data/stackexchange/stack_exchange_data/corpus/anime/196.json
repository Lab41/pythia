I read it more than a year ago. \nA guy first has the power to make a transparent round bubble like thing and everything that goes in it or touches it disappears. As the story goes on he can make a bigger bubble.  \nThen something shows up in the middle of his forehead - I think it was a third eye.  \nI don't know if I am mixing two manga together or not but I think later on the more power he uses he turns into an ET (alien) looking guy.\n"}

I saw an anime 12-15 years ago that was poorly subtitled in French. In it, the \"bad guys\" (I assume) were chasing the \"good guys\" through an industrial area/building. \nOne of the bad guys had the ability to create \"negative space\" or anti-matter bubbles. Eventually while attacking the good guys, the good guys dog (a bulldog?) gets cut in half by one of these anti-matter bubbles. The time setting of this anime, from what I remember seemed analogous to real life.\n"}
