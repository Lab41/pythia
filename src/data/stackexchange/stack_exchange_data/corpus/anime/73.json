{"post_id": "4879", "novelty": true, "cluster_id": 73, "order": 0, "body_text": "Is the amount of chakra extracted equal to the size of the part that is cut off from the Bijuu? When the Eight Tails got a part of his tail cut off, Sasuke brought back the Eight Tails' body, but only about (estimate) 94% of it (due to the tail part still remaining with Killer B in it). Does that mean that they were able to extract 94% of the Eight Tails' chakra?\nThis also applies to Ginkaku and Kinkaku, who ate whatever was in the Nine Tails' stomach. Say, they ate (wild guess) 3% of the Nine Tails' total mass (they were in there for two weeks) did they attain 3% of the Nine Tails' total chakra amount?\nI know my facts aren't spot on, I just wondered if the ratio between the amount of physical mass of Bijuu \"attained\", equaled the amount of total Bijuu chakra energy \"attained\"?\n"}
