I'm sorry, I'm sure questions like these can tend to bother some people, but I'm really having trouble figuring this one out. I found this image on tumblr. I tried searching through the notes to see if anyone had mentioned what it was from, but there were over 14,000 of them so it was a little difficult. I also tried a reverse image search on google, but its best guess was \"anime depressed tumblr\" and all the search results seem to simply be links to all the tumblrs that had reblogged it those 14,000 times, which is somewhat less than helpful... So yeah if anyone can happen to recognize it or offer any info I would greatly appreciate it.\n\nThanks!\n"}
