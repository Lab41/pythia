Madoka has a character song titled \"See You Tomorrow\" (\u307e\u305f\u3042\u3057\u305f, Mata Ashita) while Sayaka and Kyoko have a duet song titled \"And I'm Home\".\nI just found out that Homura and Mami don't have a character song (from this Puella Magi wiki page) like Madoka, Sayaka, and Kyoko do. Are there any character songs for Homura and Mami? If there aren't, why didn't they make one for them?\n"}

I have heard of these things called \"character songs\", but I don't know what they are. Is a \"character song\" just like a theme song for a character? Can you give me some examples of character songs?\n(This question is inspired by this reddit thread, where a good half of the participants seem not to get what a character song is, despite OP providing an explanation.)\n"}

Each of the arcs of the Monogatari series through the end of Second Season (Hitagi Crab, Mayoi Snail, ..., Hitagi End) has had an OP theme sung by the arc's heroine1, save for Shinobu Time (i.e. Onimonogatari), which did not have an OP theme at all.\nWhat gives? Shinobu's voice actress is Maaya Sakamoto, who is probably the most talented singer out of the entire Monogatari cast! Why didn't she sing an OP for Shinobu's arc?\n\n1 Well, the OP for Hitagi End (Koimonogatari) was sung by both Kaiki and Senjougahara, but I think we can agree that they were both the heroines of that arc.\n"}
