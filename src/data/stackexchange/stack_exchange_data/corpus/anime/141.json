In my experience, anime deviations from manga normally occur because the manga is still ongoing and original filler is not enough.\nGiven how both the Naruto anime and manga are still ongoing, I am wondering if the anime of Naruto has deviated from the manga to the point where it could break continuity with the manga\nFor example, the 2003 Fullmetal Alchemist anime breaks continuity:\n\n at Laboratory 5 or when we learn who Sloth and Wrath are\n\n"}

So happys comment actually trigged my curiosity.\n\nUhm, yeah, but they didn't need to change the series title to Bleach Shippuden owing to fillers. As for Bleach, I found the filler arcs, Fake Shinigami Arc and Zanpakuto Rebellion Arc, better than the main arcs. The two Damsel in Distress arcs, one each for Rukia and Orihime, dragged on for too long. Even the \"level 3\" battles, like the one between Ishida and Cirucci dragged on for something like 10 episodes. \u2013  Happy Dec 5 '13 at 14:12  - Has the Naruto Anime deviated from the Manga\n\nThere are allot of series out there that hold long/stretched battles, such as Bleach, Naruto, Dragon ball. But which series currently holds the record for longest battle? And I am not talking about in battle speeches. I am talking about actually fighting screen time, and the amount of episodes it is stretched over.\n"}
