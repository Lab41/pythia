One Piece is near in reaching 1000 episodes, but never in a single episode where the origin of the so called Devil Fruits is elaborated. Is there any creator of the Devil Fruits or their existence are merely phenomenal?\nI remember one episode when Blackbeard killed one of his comrades just to gain the Dark-Dark fruit, he was sure that based on its appearance, it was definitely the Yami Yami no Mi because he read it in the book about the cursed fruits.\nHow was the book written, does it imply that the author of the book is also the one who cursed the Devil Fruits? \n"}

I know that the Devil Fruits come from a tree. (Is this only a theory or really confirmed?)\nDo all different Devil Fruits come from the same tree or from different trees as usual? And where do these tree/trees grow? \nAnd how come that all Devil Fruits are scattered on so many different places in the One Piece world. How did they get there?\nA special example would be the \"Fire Devil Fruit\".\nHow and when did this Devil Fruit get on Dressrosa?\n"}
