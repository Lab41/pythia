I know that Blood-C was produced in-part by Studio Production I.G, the creators of Blood+, and it has a lot of similarities to Blood+, such as the appearance and name of the characters and the name of the manga/anime/film. Are they set in the same world or in some sort of parallel universe, or is Blood-C something like a reboot of Blood+?\n\nBlood C\n\nBlood+\n"}

I watched Blood: The Last Vampire a while back and I know there are other series like Blood+, Blood-C and Blood-C: The Last Dark and a manga called Blood.\nFrom what I read, in all of the series, the main character is a girl named Saya, and from what I took from the Movie Blood: The Last Vampire, Saya is a vampire herself. \nI am wondering if the different Blood series have any sort of connection to each other through Saya or any other connection.\n"}
