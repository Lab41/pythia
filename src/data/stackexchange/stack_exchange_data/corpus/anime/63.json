After a while from watching GITS: SaC and Second Gig and according to the Stand Alone Complex As defined[Under Different Terms] by the french philosopher Jean Baudrillard in the idea of the stand alone complex is a copy of an original copy(Simulacra As defined below):\n\nSimulation, Baudrillard claims, is the current stage of the simulacrum: All is composed of references with no referents, a hyperreality. Progressing historically from the Renaissance, in which the dominant simulacrum was in the form of the counterfeit\u2014mostly people or objects appearing to stand for a real referent (for instance, royalty, nobility, holiness, etc.) that does not exist, in other words, in the spirit of pretense, in dissimulating others that a person or a thing does not really \"have it\"\u2014to the industrial revolution, in which the dominant simulacrum is the product, the series, which can be propagated on an endless production line; and finally to current times, in which the dominant simulacrum is the model, which by its nature already stands for endless reproducibility, and is itself already reproduced.\n\nSo looking at this does this not make the concept of the stand alone complex its own copy of a previous work?\n"}
