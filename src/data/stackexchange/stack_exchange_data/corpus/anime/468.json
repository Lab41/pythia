We know of the several forms of Haki, the Kenbunshoku Haki, Busoshoku Haki and the Haoshoku Haki. I've been wondering, are those Haki visible to other characters in the One Piece universe, or only visible for the reader?\nAnd I am mainly interested in the Busoshoku Haki, as this seems to harden the body and makes the skin look metal like. Can people in the One Piece universe also see this metal like change? Or is this just for the viewer to differentiate between normal fighting and Haki fighting?\n"}

That much we all saw, but what I noticed was that he did not use Haki on the sword and yet it did  not melt.\nThis has been bugging me. How is this  possible, if Akainu's Lava can burn even fire but not melt the sword which is not even infused with Haki.\n"}
