The first animated segments seem to go back all the way to 1907, and most of those older segments only got broadcast in cinemas and the likes. Even after those, most animated segments on TV consisted of short animations of roughly a few seconds.\nSo with that my question: Which anime series was the first to be aired on Japanese television? And I am asking about multi-episode series, or multi-segment series.\n"}
