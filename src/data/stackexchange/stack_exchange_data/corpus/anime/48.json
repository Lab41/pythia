Sasuke was able to pull out Orochimaru from Kabuto.\n\nWhy is that Orochimaru can survive in different distributed forms? How is his life force immortal?\n(Sasori was able to survive using puppets for his real body, but the life force was bounded to his heart, so when the heart died, so did Sasori.)\nWhat or who can kill him permanently?
