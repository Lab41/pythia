The DVD version has various changes (animation improvements, etc). I don't believe Madoka was on Crunchyroll during airing, so is the stream from the DVD edition?\n"}

There seems to be an extreme amount of censoring in Stardust Crusaders (black shadows, etc) compared to other anime or even the previous 2 seasons.\nExamples:\n\nSmoking\nCut body parts\nBig wounds (eye stab, etc.)\n\nI don't really understand. If perhaps the smoking thing is because Jojo is underage, Sanji smoked since \"day 1\" of One Piece (he was in his teens). The wounds I don't understand either, as some other anime don't censor large wounds (like Fate/Zero, which I watched while it was airing on TV).\nExample of censorship in Stardust Crusaders:\n\nExample of Jojo season 1 no censoring on huge wound:\n\nI'm watching on Crunchyroll if it matters. Sometimes it's so bad I can't even tell what happened in the scene. Why is this? If there are any laws causing this, what laws and what do the laws say?\n"}
