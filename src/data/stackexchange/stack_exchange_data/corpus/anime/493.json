They do not have enough money so they make a dating office/place/bar or something along the lines of that.\n\nThe oldest brother is the brainy smart kind of guy so he does all of the thinking and takes care of them (like a father).\nThe middle one is the shy type, is good at cooking and is very kind and sweet (like a mother).\nThe youngest is the cutest. He is very spoiled and looks like a girl (very pretty) so they make him crossdress to trick people.\n\nIf I remember correctly, the plot was that the two older brothers start falling for the youngest one. It's a Yaoi or a Shounen Ai manga that I read a year or two ago and there were only two volumes of it.\nAll help will be appreciated.\n"}
