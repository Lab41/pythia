I've noticed that in some anime the protagonist is seated by the window in the classroom. More specifically, the protagonist is generally on the second seat from the back (or sometimes on the very last seat).\nI don't know if this happens in every anime, but it seems to happen on at least some.  \n \n \nTop: Tomoko from Watamote (left), Touma from Index (right). Bottom: Light from Death Note (left), Tenma from School Rumble (right).\nWhy does this happen?\nDoes it have something to do with character conception or mood setting?\nIs it a plot device or something else? \n"}
