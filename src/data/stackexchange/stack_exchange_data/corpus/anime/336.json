There are a number of very clear parallels between Tokyo Mew Mew and Sailor Moon, beyond the fact that they're both magical girl animes. At 7:35 of this, the scene is incredibly similar to this at 00:53:10. There are other very striking similarities, like the personalities of the characters. Have the creators of either series commented on the similarities?\n"}

Here's a screenshot of them in-game (in their own game).\n\nKnowing Akiba's Trip and its countless references, I can't think that this isn't a reference to some magical girl series. Unfortunately, I don't know enough magical girl series - and there isn't much info about the girls on the internet.\nI'm somewhat inclined to think they're a parody of Pretty Cure because of their vibrant colour scheme, but it's got a load of different series so I'm not sure if they are or not.\nAt one stage the Akiba's Trip girls cosplay as the characters, so possibly some of that bare skin is fan service on AT's part:\n\nAre the Stripism girls a parody of Pretty Cure? Or any other anime series?\n"}
