I watched Berserk years ago and I'm thinking of introducing someone else to it, but I'm told that the OVAs do the original manga more justice. I've not seen the OVAs just the anime series, how much of the same ground do they cover?\nIf I remember correctly the original anime series just cut off with no resolution. \n"}

Since I really enjoyed them, I decided to start watching the anime as well. \nThe anime however, starts a while after the events in the movies since Guts already has his mark. Reading the berserk wiki, it states that a lot of events are missing in the anime.\nNow, since I especially care about Berserk's storyline, I was wondering if I should start watching the Anime from start to end, jump in a few episodes of the Anime to get the chronological order right, or skip the anime all together and just read the manga?\nThanks in advance for the help. If I have been unclear, please leave a comment.\n"}
