So I just heard of this anime that resembles the Mafia/Wolf game.\n\nHowever, when Makoto arrives inside the Academy, he loses consciousness and wakes up locked inside the school, where he meets fourteen other newly picked Ultimate students who are in the same situation as him. It is there that a sadistic, remote-controlled bear named Monokuma appears before them, telling them they will be imprisoned in the academy for the rest of their lives, and that they will be put to death if they violate any of the schools rules. He offers only one way for students to \"graduate\" from the academy: murder another student and not be identified as the culprit.\n\nSo if the culprit is correctly identified (majority vote or something?), culprit gets executed. If not, everyone but culprit gets executed.\nWhat is supposed to happen if there are 2 or 3 players left?\nI'm not so naive as to think that what is supposed to happen is what actually happens, but I think there should be a rule for that.\nIf there is no explanation in the anime or other media, please state such and if applicable why no explanation is needed (I might be overlooking something obvious).\nLiar Game had a rule as to what happens in Minority Rule if there are only 2 players left. There was some detail about it. I don't think explaining that rule spoils the manga or series: If there are 2 left, the prize is split. To drop out, half of the prize must be given back, whatever the amount of the prize is (half of the full 2.1 billion or half of 1.05 billion).\nPS I'm done with the anime. Go ahead and spoil other media. But please use spoiler tags for others.\n"}
