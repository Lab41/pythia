I remember so little about it, but I hope it will ring a bell with someone.\nIt was about a girl, I believe she was living in a flooded, primarily ocean world (sort of like a water world). The best detail I can give is that she had this unique necklace that I think was a single spherical red coral bead on it.\nIf this sounds familiar at all, please let me know if you know the name.\nI wanted to think it was simple, like \"Blue\", \"Aqua\" or something similar for a title.\nEdit:\nI know now that it is not Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water, and it is also not the title Aqua.\nI remember it had a similar art style feel to the older manga of the 70s and 80s such as The Land with Silver Rain, and The Rose of Versailles. I feel like it may be an older title.\n"}

The pets can turn into cars, tanks, etc. and originate from some other dimension. The protagonist has his arm eaten off by his own pet (if I remember correctly) because the pet feeds off of the life force of its owner. The protagonist's pet needs extra energy to transform during an intense battle. Later, his pet takes the place of his arm. \nThis anime used to be on the list of things people also searched for when looking for Pale Cocoon. It seems like I came across this in 2010 or 2011, although I'm not sure if this was when it originally aired.\n"}
