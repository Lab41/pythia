I remember reading a manga online but I can't remember the name.\nIt's about a high school girl who might be an otaku? I'm not sure, and her other 'cute' friend getting sucked into another dimension because one of them has the power to make swords and shields at will using her imagination. The people who took them there thought her cute friend had the power but it was actually the other one.\nThat's all I can remember. Please help me find it! It's killing me not being able to remember the name.\n"}
