The girl's parents were killed and the boy wants to protect her, so he hides her in her house. \nShe might have amnesia so she doesn't remember much. The guy commits crimes to dispose of evidence. \nThe guy is blonde I believe. And the girl has black hair(?) The drawing style is rather simple, and the guy keeps saying he loves her, so that's why he's doing this. The manga is short.\n"}
