In ep. 23, after both protagonists fall into the cold water below the bridge (astonishingly, without breaking any body parts in such shallow waters), Ryuji proposes to Taiga, and tells her that they could stay on the run until he is 18, and then marry.\nFrom the US embassy orientation about Japanese marriage:\n\nArticle 731 to 737 of the Japanese Civil Code stipulates the following requirements:\n\nThe male partner must be 18 years of age or older and the female partner must be 16 years of age or older.\nIn addition, for Americans, you must be able to legally marry in your home state; if the legal age of marriage at home is 18, you cannot marry earlier than that in Japan.\nA woman cannot get married within six months of the dissolution of her previous marriage. According to Japanese law, this is to avoid confusion as to the identification of a child's father if a birth occurs close in time to the end of the marriage.\nMost people related by blood, by adoption or through other marriages cannot get married in Japan.\nA person who is under 20 years of age cannot get married in Japan without a parent's approval.\n\n\nThe last line means that they would have to keep on the run for two more years if they were to marry without consent.\nIs it supposed to illustrate a blunder caused by a lack of information with the teenage characters, or there was a way for them to get married without parental consent?\n"}
