In FMA: Brotherhood, Alphonse recover the memories he lost after going through the Gate, by having Martel's blood spattered over his own blood seal (the one that binds his soul to his armor), and is, henceworth, able to use the knowledge inherent to it, such as using alchemy without transmutation circles.\nIs there a reason for which blood should have been splattered over his seal for him to recover his memories?\nOr was it only coincidence/traumatic?\n"}

We know a couple of characters whose souls are bound to armor suits, e.g. Alphonse or Barry the Chopper. It was explicitly shown that the armor suits have nothing inside - which means they are just pieces of metal with an rune that binds the soul to the armor. \n\nSo how are they able to move at all, not to mention that they have significant physical strength and agility?\n"}

In Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, how come Alphonse can sometimes perform alchemy, and at other times it seems he can't? Also, early on the show, wasn't it said that he lost his ability when he lost his body? And if he can do alchemy, why isn't he a state alchemist too?\n"}
