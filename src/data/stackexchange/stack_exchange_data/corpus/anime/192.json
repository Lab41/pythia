So the following questions arise out of this situation.\n\nDid he know Tobi's real identity?\nWhy did he take his help to eliminate the clan(irrespective of whether his identity was known or not)? \nWhy did he help Tobi by not revealing that he was the village infiltrator as Itachi was always working for the Village?\nWhy did Tobi agree to help Itachi eliminate his own clan?\n\nIdeally each question here should be a separate question but in this scenario all these are closely inter-related and thus been posted as a single question.\n"}

He knew that Itachi massacred his entire clan only for the village's sake. \n\nThen why did he let Itachi join the Akatsuki?\n\nHe was also aware that Itachi was trying to protect the leaf village from Akatsuki. So my next question is \n\nWhy didn't he get rid of Itachi at least after they start to capture the tailed beasts?\n\n"}
