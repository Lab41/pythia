At the end of the last episode of Cowboy Bebop, Spike collapses.  It's not clear, but it looks as though he may be dead.  Is there a way to know whether he is alive or dead (something in the background, comments from the director, a continuation in the story in the manga, etc.)\n"}

I don't recall anything that had happened in the anime to be vital for the movie, and I don't remember anything that happened in the movie to be vital for episodes 23 onwards.\nAm I missing something? Or does it fit between episodes 22 and 23 simply because the authors thought about it like that (maybe the authors thought about the timeline like that, although it may be irrelevant?)?\n"}
{"post_id": "1957", "novelty": true, "cluster_id": 1, "order": 2, "body_text": "When does the Cowboy Bebop Manga take place within the Anime? I know that the Cowboy Bebop manga was written and produced by someone other than Shinichiro Watanabe (although the English credits say: Cooperation: Shinichiro Watanabe / Sunrise); the manga Cowboy Bebop, shortly after the TV series ended, and that for all intents and purposes, they are the same canon as the TV series and movie; and the manga Cowboy Bebop: Shooting Star, which was written alongside the original TV series airing. The chapters themselves are pretty similar to an episode of the TV series, so are there specific time frames, or episodes that these chapters are reported to take place? Or is it ambiguous and can safely sit somewhere in the middle of the series (after all the cast have been introduced and are together, before the cast start separating)? Is \"Shooting Star\" on a completely different timeline?\n"}
