This answer on Yahoo! says he became a Jounin at the age of 13, which makes him the youngest Jounin.\n\nI have heard a lot of chatter on the subject, but I've never seen the answer stated outright (or with any proof). The youngest I've seen reference to was Kakashi. He was a chunin at 6, a jonin at 10, and joined ANBU Black Ops at 13.\nItachi, on the other hand, became a chunin at 10 and became a Captain of ANBU Black Ops at 13. He's still pretty amazing, but Kakashi was younger.\nSources:\n\nhttp://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Kakashi_Hatake\nhttp://www.absoluteanime.com/naruto/itachi.htm\n\n\nIs it true that he is the youngest Jounin? What is his real age when he became a Jounin?\nThe magic number starts from at the age of 5\n"}

I've been doing a lot of research on this topic, but I have found little clues.

While watching these filler episodes, he appears as the ANBU Kakashi, who was leading his team. Being the Senpai of Itachi he looks exactly (maybe for me) like he does in the present day... Is this a coincidence? Or couldn't the animators be bother to add additional \"lines\" to his face? Note that we've seen the newborn Naruto, that would mean that Kakashi looks the same as he did 17-18 years ago..\n"}
