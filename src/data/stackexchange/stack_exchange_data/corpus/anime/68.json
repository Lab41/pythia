Lots of speculations have been made as to the time frame and location using clues from within the manga and animation.....but why not just ask the series creator if he gave it much thought or is the story just a mishmash of past and future technologies. I'm sure much Japanese writing has been done on this topic that hasn't been translated.....or perhaps, we Westerners are more concerned about this than we should be.\n"}
