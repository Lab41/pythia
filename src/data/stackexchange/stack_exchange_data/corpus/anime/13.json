When Tobi uses his selective teleportation power that causes objects to pass through him, does he have to think about it when he does it, or is it automatic?  I'm trying to find out if he is vulnerable to a sneak attack.\nI know he is able to teleport at will, but I'm wondering more about his \"ghost\" ability that causes objects to pass through him.\n"}
{"post_id": "2035", "novelty": true, "cluster_id": 13, "order": 1, "body_text": "Why is there a time limit on Tobi's dematerialization technique? This question contains spoilers for early manga readers and anime viewers\nKonan mentions during her fight with Tobi that Tobi's dematerialization technique can last for only 5 minutes. This can be confirmed as true since Tobi resorts to Izanagi to escape her ultimate technique, Kami no Shisha no Jutsu. It is later revealed that Tobi's dematerialization technique is actually just teleporting himself into his alternate dimension with Kamui.\nHowever, earlier during the Five Kage meeting arc, he had teleported Sasuke and Karin and kept them in the alternate dimension for quite a long time. He also kept Fu and Torune in the alternate dimension for several days. This shows that he does not face any significant side-effects, like draining chakra, by keeping people in the other dimension. Also, staying in the alternate dimension did not seem to have any adverse effect, on at least Sasuke and Karin.\nWhy can Tobi not keep himself in the alternate dimension for more than 5 minutes? In particular, why could he not just escape Konan's ultimate technique by staying in his alternate dimension for 10 minutes, rather than use Izanagi?\n"}
