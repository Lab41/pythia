In episode 8 of Puella Magi Madoka Magica, we see Sayaka transform into a witch, and in that episode and the subsequent one (at least in the second half of it) we see Kyouko's attempt to save her.\nWhy exactly does she seem so determined to do this, given that she'd talked earlier about living for oneself? (e.g. Perhaps out of sympathy for Sayaka's situation or a change of heart? Or maybe because of her \"goals\", which don't seem to be very well-specified when referred to in episode 9?)\n"}
