I remember Captain Ginyu exclaiming that Goku had a power level of 180,000 in the Ginyu Force arc, but I don't recall a higher scouter being shown/read aloud in any other episode/movie of DBZ (I'm not including Frieza's 1 million bluff).\nDoes anyone have more information on this from a credible source? If official data is available, I would also want to know the power levels of a regular Super Saiyan, SS2 and SS3 as well.\n"}
