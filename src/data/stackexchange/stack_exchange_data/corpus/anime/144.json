I've been trying to re-find an anime I saw like 5-6 years ago. The only things I can remember is that it was about a warrior who got expelled from his order. I think he had brownish hair and a bright (yellow) sword. There was like some number of his former order members (6?) that he was fighting against throughout the series. It was happening in an alternate world and there was a lot of desert there.\n"}
