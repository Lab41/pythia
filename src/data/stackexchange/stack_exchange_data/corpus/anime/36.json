In the final round of the Chuunin Exams, when the match between Neji and Naruto starts, Neji is surprised when Naruto uses Kage Bunshin no Jutsu. He had seen Naruto use the same technique in the match against Kiba in the preliminaries. So he should have known that they were solid clones that can fight unlike the clones created by the Bunshin no Jutsu.  \nWhy was Neji surprised when he saw Naruto's shadow clones? \nWas Neji unaware of the Kage Bunshin Jutsu, which is a very popular jutsu used by the shinobi?\n"}

While the Kage Bunshin no Jutsu seems to be taught, the Tajuu Kage Bunshin no Jutsu is sealed, so nobody can learn the jutsu. Does that mean that there's a difference between these jutsus, aside from the number of Kage Bunshin created? \nOr, why was the Tajuu Kage Bunshin no Jutsu sealed away?\nIf there's no other difference, everybody could use this without reading the sealed scroll.\n"}
