I remember the box art was mainly yellow, and the main character had a look of Ash Ketchum from the Pokemon series. I'm not sure whether it was actually released by Manga, but the animation style definitely looked like it was Japanese.\nAll I remember about the story was that there was a large robot that didn't look humanoid - just sort of an elongated ball shape with a domed head. It moved along a desert for a short while, stopped, cried out something, then shot a massive beam of light from its head. Either just after or just before this happened, loads of small creatures that resembled fried eggs were hopping over the desert land. This started off as one creature, then a few, then hundreds.\nI know it's really vague, but it would really make my day to know what it was called so I could watch it again. I must have picked it up in the early to mid nineties on VHS, so it has to be from that period or before.\n"}

When I was little, I used to own this film on VHS:\n\nI'm pretty sure that the version I had was called The Talisman.\nI'm trying to find it again, preferably a digital version so that I can burn it to disk, but I can't seem to find it anywhere. It's also coming up with different names when I search for it: The Talisman, The World of The Talisman, and Birth.\nThe version I owned was an American dub, and I'd love to find it again, as it is a film my brother and I used to always watch, so it has a lot of nostalgia.\n"}
