I was watching the Akame ga Kill ONAs, and in AkaKill Theater episode 22, Kurome is constantly pointing out that Akame doesn't get enough air-time even though the series is named after her and talking smack to her.\nShe then says something starting with Ba-, and is immediately censored. The dialogue goes something like this:\n\nRun: We're just about out of time, so let's at least have a good-\nKurome: Sis. Ba-  * censored *\nEveryone is stunned, the display in the back says  \"She actually said it!\" \nRun: So I think, that's enough for today\nAkame: (Super Pissed) Kurome, meet me outside\n\n\n\nSo what does she say?\n"}

She doesn't have an integral role in the plot, and she is not an essential character: her absence wouldn't had changed the framework of the story significantly.\nThough she did fight an amazing battle, this doesn't seem like it should differentiate her from the others, because all the other members did the same thing. The only difference is that \n\nshe fought Esdeath, the primary antagonist, and ultimately survived.\n\nHowever, on the other hand, the show is named after her.

Just what the title says, why is the show called Akame ga Kill! and what does it even mean? Akame was just an ordinary member of Night Raid, yet the show is named after her. She wasn't the main Protagonist, she wasn't even the main Waifu! And as this unanswered question mentions here, the only difference was:\n\n She fought Esdeath, the primary antagonist, and ultimately survived.\n\nI googled a bit and came across this link, according to which Akame ga Kill! literally means:\n\nAkame is kill \n\nSo what does that even mean? Does it mean that Akame is Death itself, or Akame is Dead (Not physically, but mentally - that she is dead inside). But I doubt that either of these interpretations are correct since she acts all cutesy from time to time.\nAs another user points out, a general translation would be Akame Kills, but that would be a very stupid name, wouldn't it? So can anyone help clear this up?\n\nEdit: Even Akame knows something's not right (from AkaKILL Theater Episode 24 - END).\n\n"}
