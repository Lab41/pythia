I read an article recently that states:\n\n\"Akira\" rewrote every rule for animation. It was filmed at 24 frames per second, in full Cinemascope aspect, using 312 colors in the palette (the richest palette for any hand-done animation ever).\n\nBased on this article, it seems Akira was the first anime (or perhaps animation) to be filmed at 24fps. Is it the only anime to do so, or did others do this later on as well?\n"}

I only watched the first episode of Knights of Sidonia, and the main reason I dropped it was that the CG ran at an unbearably low framerate. I just took another look at it, and it looks like most of it past the opening sequence was \"on threes\".\nI can understand why it's rare for anime to do hand-drawn animation (besides pans/etc) on ones - it takes a lot of work!\nBut I can't comprehend why this would happen with Sidonia - it was 100% CG! It seems like cranking the framerate up to twos or ones would just be a matter of changing a setting in whatever tool they were using to render the CG. Last year's \"Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio\" was full-CG too, and it didn't have this problem...\nDo we know why the CG framerate was so low? Was it production issues, or an artistic choice, or...? (Side question: did it get better in later episodes and/or on the BD?)\n"}
