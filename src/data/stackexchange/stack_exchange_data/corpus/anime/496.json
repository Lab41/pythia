Unlike any other characters, only Sanji's poster are drawn. \n\nIn chapter 436, they ask the photographer, but there's no reply (or at least the answer didn't revealed after).\n\nDid he really forget to take off the lens cap? \nHow could he forget to take off the lens cap, if he managed to get another picture of the rest Luffy's crew?\n"}

After reading this question about why Sanji's bounty poster is drawn, not his real picture. I was just thinking about the bounty posters itself.\nI know that aside from Luffy, the rest of the crew's bounty posters are taken after Ennies Lobby arc.\nBut how about their bounty hunters picture after time skip? \nI know it's probably when they are in dressrosa, but if I saw Sanji's and Chopper's posters, it's seems that their posters are taken in Sabaody Island.\nAnd also Franky's bounty poster taken when he's in Punk Hazard or Fishman Island because it's shown his Franky Shogun, not his true face.\nHe only used Franky Shogun at Punk Hazard when battle with Buffallo and Baby 5 and when he's battle Fishman Pirate at Fishman Island.\nSo, I want to know where and when Mugiwara Crew's new bounty posters were taken?\n"}
