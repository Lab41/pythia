In the hospital where Sakakibara was having his checkups and where Sanae worked, the elevator had no 4th floor.\nNow, I know in Japanese culture the numbers 4 (\u56db shi) and 7 (\u4e03 shichi) have \"shi\" in them which is \"death\" (\u6b7b shi) and the Japanese are very superstitious, so they have alternate names for 4 and 7 (yon and nana).\nSo I'm wondering, is it just in Another, where the theme is death, that the 4th floor (and possibly the 7th floor, never really noticed) is missing, or is it a cultural thing in Japan to label the 4th floor as the 5th floor?\n"}
