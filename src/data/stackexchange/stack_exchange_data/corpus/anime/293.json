However, I wonder why filler episodes exist.\nAt first, I thought it was to allow the manga to advance a bit more when the anime was catching up. However, in Naruto (for example), the manga has finished and the anime still has fillers.\nFor other series like One Piece, the anime is relatively close to the manga and there are no fillers (Thanks God!)\nWhat's the purpose of filler episodes?\n"}

The most obvious answer everyone over the Internet is giving to this question is \"Because anime is produced much faster compared to manga, they need to put in fillers in order to slow down the anime series\".

Comparing that to Naruto, the show has almost the same number of episodes (original and Shippuuden combined), but almost 50% of its episodes are fillers.

The general rule seems to be that filler is made when an anime is being produced faster than the manga. The thing I just can't seem to figure out is\n\nHow an entire freaking episode takes longer to produce than a manga which practically only equals a story board.\nWhy would they start producing random filler rather than just overtaking the manga with their own story.\n\nI mean, is this some Japanese cultural thing where a lot of credit is given to the author of the manga and he isn't allowed to collaborate with others to speed up production or is this a cultural thing where Japanese actually like those fillers or what? After all, there are a lot of economic incentives not to produce filler episodes as they tend to irritate fans a lot and still cost a lot to produce.\n"}
