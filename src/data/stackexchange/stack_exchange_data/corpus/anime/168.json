In How to Use: XIII, in the second point it says\n\nThe god of Death always remains with the owner of the Death Note.\n\nindicating that a Shinigami will remain with the owner of their Death Note, Light learns this and gathers a group of friends to try and hide himself with Ryuk following him when Misa is trying to find him (she finds him because of her Eyes)\nHowever, the Death Note Light had in the beginning isn't Ryuk's but Sidoh's which Ryuk stole, and unlike Gelus who died and Rem probably obtained ownership of Gelus's Death Note afterwards, Sidoh was still alive so even if Light became the owner after Ryuk dropped it in the human world, the Shinigami who was supposed to be with like was Sidoh.\nAlso in How to Use 2, the second point says\n\nThe owner of the note can recognize the image and voice of the original owner, i.e. a god of death. \n\nSo is there an explanation as to how Ryuk was tied with Light's Death Note having stolen it from Sidoh?\n"}

Rem warned Light not to hurt Misa or it would kill Light by writing his name in it's Deathnote, but Ryuk had mentioned in the last episode as well as before that either Ryuk would kill Light or that Light would die after living his natural lifespan. As Ryuk has to kill him, was Rem's warning a bluff?\nIf so, couldn't Light, being a genius, see through his bluff?? \n"}
