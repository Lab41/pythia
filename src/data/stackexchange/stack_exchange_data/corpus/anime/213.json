All I remember about the anime was that I had watched it back when I was little. I think it might have been on Toonami. The anime was very heavily a sci-fi anime. From what I remember the main antagonist's face almost looked similar to a sharks face and his \"Father\", the man who created him had glasses with long grey hair, a hawianish shirt on (no not master roshi) and a huge machine that plugged into his heart and kept him alive until the end of the movie or series (don't know if it was a movie or not). He walked a long the beach and died, this is also when the main antagonist lost. If this rings a bell for anyone it'd be much appreciated because i cant seem to find this anime anywhere.\n"}
