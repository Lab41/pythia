I just started watching the anime and I haven't read much of the manga so I don't know if it is explained further on.\nWe all know a Titan's body gives off extreme heat, from an encounter Eren had with the Colossal Titan and an episode where they learned this in class.\nIn episode 6, when Mikasa killed a Titan, we saw the body still giving off heat..\n\n..and a few minutes later it was pretty badly burnt, unrecognizable in fact.\n\nLater in episode 7 when Eren in his Titan form attacks another and beats it to a pulp, we see that the process has somewhat accelerated? At first I thought the body eventually burned away but this one was different than the first. All of the Titan's flesh was gone.\n\n\nSo, what exactly happens to a Titan's body structure after it is killed? Does the heat burn it up now that it cannot regenerate or what?\n"}
