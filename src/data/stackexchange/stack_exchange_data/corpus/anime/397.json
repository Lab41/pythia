I don't remember the name, but I'm sure it's nothing new. I saw it on Netflix for the Wii.\nI remember a young girl (main character) around 12 to 14 years old with purple hair, and her friends. One of her friends (a brown haired boy) who also has a crush on her gets really worried when a long white haired man appears and says he has to protect the purple haired girl.\nThey later find out that the shady white haired man is actually the little brown haired boy, but from the future. He returned to the past to either spend time with the purple haired girl, or to save her.\nIn the future, humans are forced to live underground, because of these weird alien giants, and it's sandy above the ground.\nI have been looking for a couple years and still have no idea. Please help if you can.\n"}
