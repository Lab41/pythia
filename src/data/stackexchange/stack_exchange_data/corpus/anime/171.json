I think Adult Swim was where I saw it.\nThis girl runs off and joins this team that's in a race with a bunch of other alien species. Her dad is the leader but he doesn't know the girl is his daughter. Her mother was a pilot and she died in a race so the dad didn't want the daughter to race. There's an alien that has a white mask and shadow powers sorta. People think it killed her mother, bit it tried to help her before the ship exploded.\nthere's like this mother ship like thing that's the 'garages' are on and it moves to right above the next race start and then the racers drop from the ship.\nThank you in advance for any help given.\n"}

He says its main character is a little red-haired girl who pilots a racing pod. The pod has two large guns on each side. She uses this pod in a race of some kind. The organizer of the race fools the girl into thinking there is a prize but there isn't one. He also thinks the girls has something that looks like 2 band-aides on each side of her mouth.\nI know this seems vague, but any help is much appreciated.\n"}
