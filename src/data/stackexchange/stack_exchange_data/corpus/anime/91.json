I came across the difference between the Flying Thunder God Technique and Obito's Kamui Technique Transportation Technique, here.\nBut what I am struck with the fact that Fourth Hokage used a Space-Time Barrier tecnique to teleport Nine-Tail's Tailed Beast Ball. So my questions are:\n\nIs Space-Time Barrier similar to Flying Thunder God Technique?\nIs it used to transport things using Teleportation Technique?\n\n"}

In Naruto Shippuden, Minato Namikaze, the Fourth Hokage, used the teleportation technique (Hiraishin no Jutsu) . Tobi on the other hand uses the transportation technique (Kamui). \nHow are the transportation jutsu and the teleportation jutsu different since both involve displacing stuff to other locations?\n"}
